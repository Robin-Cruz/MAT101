<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>As we graph lines, we will want to be able to identify different properties of the
lines we graph. One of the most important properties of a line is its slope. Slope
is a measure of steepness. A line with a large slope, such as 25, is very steep. A
line with a small slope, such as \(\frac{1}{10}\) is very flat. We will also use slope to describe
the direction of the line. A line that rises from left to right will have a positive
slope and a line that falls from left to right will have a negative slope. A horizontal line will have zero slope.
As we measure steepness we are interested in how fast the line rises compared to
how far the line runs. For this reason we will describe slope as the fraction \(\dfrac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}\).</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-38.html#p-408">in-context</a></span>
