<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>As we move
to the right of the origin the numbers count up
from zero, representing \(x=1, 2, 3\dots\).  To the left the numbers count down from zero, representing \(x = - 1, - 2, - 3\dots\).
Similarly, as we move up from the origin the number count up from zero, \(y = 1, 2, 3\dots\), and as we
move down count down from zero, \(y = -1, -2, -3, \dots\). We can put dots on the
graph which we will call points. Each point has an "address" that defines its location.
The first number will be the value on the \(x\)-axis or horizontal number line.
This is the distance the point moves left/right from the origin. The second
number will represent the value on the \(y\)-axis or vertical number line. This is
the distance the point moves up/down from the origin. The points are given as an
ordered pair \((x, y)\).</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-36.html#p-384">in-context</a></span>
