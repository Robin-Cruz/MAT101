Let set \(A\) represent those surveyed with automatic transmissions.
Let set \(S\) represent those surveyed with standard transmissions.
  
Since \(12\) drove cars of both types
    Record \(\color{red}{12}\) in \(A\) AND \(S\) \(=A\cap S\).That is \(n(A\cap S)=\color{red}{12}\).

    Let \(\color{blue}{x}\) be the number in \(A\) but NOT in \(S\).
    Then \(\color{blue}{x}=n(A\cap S')\).
     Let \(\color{green}{y}\) be the number in \(S\) but NOT in \(A\).
     Then \(\color{green}{y}=n(S\cap A')\).

 Because \(30\) people drove cars with automatic transmissions, 
    the circle \(A\) must contain \(30\) total people. 
    This means \(x + 12 = 30\).
        Subtract \(12\) from both sides to get
         \(x = 18\).
    Record \(\color{blue}{18}\) in \(A\) but NOT in \(S\).

 Because \(20\) people drove cars with standard transmissions, 
    the circle \(S\) must contain \(20\) total people. 
    This means \(y + 12 = 20\).
        Subtract \(12\) from both sides to get
         \(y = 8\).
    Record \(\color{green}{8}\) in \(S\) but NOT in \(A\).

Now that all the information is sorted out, 
        it is easy to read from the diagram that:
\(\color{blue}{18}\) people drove cars with automatic transmissions only, 
      \(\color{red}{12}\) people drove both types of cars, and 
      \(\color{green}{8}\) drove cars with standard transmissions only.
  
\(18+12+8=38\)
Our Solution: \(38\) people participated in the survey.
