In this graph there is no rise, but the
run is 3 units. This slope becomes \(\frac{0}{3}=0\). This line,
and all horizontal lines have a zero slope.
This line has a rise of 5, but no run.
The slope becomes  \(\frac{5}{0}=\)
undefined. This line,
and all vertical lines, have no slope.
  </figure><p>As you can see there is a big difference between having a zero slope and having no
slope or undefined slope. Remember, slope is a measure of steepness. The first
slope is not steep at all, in fact it is flat. Therefore it has a zero slope. The
second slope can't get any steeper. It is so steep that there is no number large
enough to express how steep it is. This is an undefined slope.</p>
<p>We can find the slope of a line through two points without seeing the points on a
graph. We can do this using a slope formula. If the rise is the change in \(y\) values,
we can calculate this by subtracting the \(y\) values of a point. Similarly, if run is a
change in the \(x\) values, we can calculate this by subtracting the \(x\) values of a
point. In this way we get the following equation for slope:</p>
<p>The slope of a line through \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is \(\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\)
</p>
<p>When mathematicians began working with slope, it was called the modular slope.
For this reason we often represent the slope with the variable \(m\). Now we have
the following for slope:</p>
<p>Slope \(=m=\dfrac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\dfrac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in }x}
=\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\)</p>
<p>As we subtract the \(y\) values and the \(x\) values when calculating slope it is important
we subtract them in the same order. This process is shown in the following
examples.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-38.html#example-159">in-context</a></span>
