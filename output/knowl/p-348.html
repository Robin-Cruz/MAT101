<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>One application of exponent properties comes from scientific notation. Scientific
notation is used to represent really large or really small numbers. An example of a
really large number would be the distance that light travels in a year in miles.
An example of a really small number would be the mass of a single hydrogen atom
in grams. Doing basic operations such as multiplication and division with these
numbers would normally be very cumbersome. However, our exponent properties
make this process much simpler.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-33.html#p-348">in-context</a></span>
