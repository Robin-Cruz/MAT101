<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>If there are several parenthesis in a problem we will start with the inner most parenthesis and work our way out. Inside each parenthesis we simplify using the order of operations as well. To make it easier to know which parenthesis goes with which parenthesis, different types of parenthesis will be used such as { } and [ ] and ( ), these parenthesis all mean the same thing, they are parenthesis and must be evaluated first.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-3.html#p-39">in-context</a></span>
