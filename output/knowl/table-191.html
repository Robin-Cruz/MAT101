\(D=\) distance from Caldwell
Recall what the response variable represents
  
When is \(225=D\)?
Write an equation to model the problem
  
\(225=65t+30\)
<!--Style me with CSS--><em>This is an equation to model the problem. </em> 
    Solve for \(t\): subtract \(30\) from both sides
  
\(195=65t\)
Divide both sides by \(65\)
  
\(3=t\)
State what this means in context
  
After \(t=3\) hours of cruise control 
     you are \(225\) miles from Caldwell
Our solution
  
The graph of the linear model demonstrates the
    \(D\)-intercept of \(30\) miles,
    increasing slope of \(65\) mph and 
    distance of \(225\)miles when the time is \(3\) hours.
