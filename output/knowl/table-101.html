<figure class="figure-like">
\(3(4x-5)-4(2x+1)=5\)
Distribute the \(3\) and \(-4\) through parenthesis
  
\(12x-15-8x-4=5\)
Combine like terms \(12x-8x\) and \(-15-4\)
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,4x-19=5\)
Focus on the subtraction of \(19\)
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\underline{+19\,\,\,\, +19}\)
Add \(19\) to both sides
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, 4x=24\)
Focus on the multiplication by \(4\)
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{4}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \overline{4}\)
Divide both sides by \(4\)
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, x=6\)
