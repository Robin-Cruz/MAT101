The intersection of the points in the graph
would be all values in both the first interval AND the second 
This is points common to both (or in the overlap)
For example, \(-3\) is NOT in the bottom interval \((-2, \infty)\), so \(-3\) is NOT in the intersection
and \(2.7\) is NOT in the top interval \((-\infty, 2]\), so \(2.7\) is NOT in the intersection
but since \(-\frac{1}{3}\) is in both intervals, \(-\frac{1}{3}\) IS in the intersection
  
\((-2, 2]\)
An interval describing the intersection
  
\(-2 \lt x \leq 2\)
An inequality describing the intersection
