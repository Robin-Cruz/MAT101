<h1>MAT-101: Set 1C-Sets, Intervals and Inequalities</h1>
</p>

<h3>Objectives:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use set operations including union, intersection and complement. </li>
          <li> Use Venn diagrams to illustrate relations between sets.</li>
          <li> Use inequality and interval notation.</li>
        </ul>

<H2>Sets</H2>

<p>
In this section, we will familiarize ourselves with set operations and notations, so that we can apply these
concepts to both counting and probability problems. We begin by defining some terms.</p>

<p> A <b>set</b> is a collection of objects, and its members are called the <b>elements</b> of the set. We name the set by
using capital letters, and enclose its members in braces \({\cdots}\). Suppose we need to list the members of the chess
club. We use the following set notation:

\[C=\{\text{Ken, Bob, Tran, Shanti, Eric}\}\]

A set that has no members is called an <b>empty set</b>. The empty set is denoted by the symbol \(\emptyset\) or with empty curly braces \(\{\}\).</p>
<p>
Two sets are <b>equal</b> if they have the same elements.
</p>
<p>
A set \(A\) is a <b>subset</b> of a set \(B\) if every member of \(A\) is also a member of \(B\). For example, suppose \(C = \{\text{Al, Bob, Chris, David, Ed}\}\) and \(A = \{\text{Bob, David}\}\). Then \(A\) is a subset of \(C\), written as \(A\subseteq C\).
</p>

<p>
Notes: Every set is a subset of itself, \(A \subseteq A\). The empty set is a subset of every set, \(\emptyset \subseteq A\).
</p>

<H2>Union Of Two Sets</H2>
<p>

Let \(A\) and \(B\) be two sets, then the union of \(A\) and \(B\), written as \(A\cup B\), is the set of all elements that are either in \(A\) or in \(B\), or in both \(A\) and \(B\).  When you see the union symbol \(\cup\) you should think <em>or</em>.
</p>
<H3>Example 1C-1: Union</H3>

Let \(A=\{1,4,5,6,8\}\) and   \(B=\{4,5,6,7\}\) be two sets of integers.
<!-- Modeled after WeBWorK Problems/MAT105_Templates/setAlgebra_04_02_CompoundIneq/42IntAlg_01_CompoundIneq.pg -->

<center>
<table class = "center">
 <tr>
    <td align="right">Determine \(A\cup B\)</td>
    <td>The union is the collection of all elements from both sets:</br>
    integers in \(A\) <b>OR</b> \(B\)  (or both) </td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">\(A\cup B=\{1,4,5,6,7,8 \}\)</td>
    <td>Our Solution <div class="WWbox">
                       Type <b>{1,4,5,6,7,8} </b> for \(\{1,4,5,6,7,8 \} \) in <tt>WeBWorK.</tt> Elements of sets are contained in curly braces.
                       </div></td>

  </tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
Notice in the solution to<b> Example 1C-1</b>, the integer \(4\) is not written in the list of elements twice even thought it is in both sets \(A\) and \(B\).  This is because there is only one integer \(4\).
</p>

<H2>Intersection Of Two Sets</H2>
<p>
Let \(A\) and \(B\) be two sets, then the intersection of \(A\) and \(B\), written as \(A\cap B\), is the set of all elements that are common to both sets \(A\) and \(B\). That is to say the set of all elements in \(A\) that are also in \(B\).  When you see the intersection symbol \(\cap\) you should think <em>and</em>.
</p>
<h3>Example 1C-2: Intersection</h3>
Let \(A=\{1,4,5,6,8\}\) and   \(B=\{4,5,6,7\}\) be two sets of integers.

<center>
<table class = "center">
 <tr>
    <td align="right">Find \(A\cap B\)</td>
    <td>The intersection is the collection of all elements common to  both sets:</br>
    integers in \(A\) <b>AND</b> \(B\)  (common to both)</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">\(A\cap B=\{4,5,6 \}\)</td>
    <td>Our Solution</td>

  </tr>
</table>
</center>

<H2>Universal Set</H2>
<p>
A <b>universal set</b> \(U\) is the set consisting of all elements under consideration.  For example, if we were interested in computing probabilities of particular poker hands the universal set would be the set of all \(52\) cards in a regular deck of cards.  If we were interested in GPAs of students at C of I, the universal set \(U=\{\text{GPAs of all students at C of I}\}\).  Or the universal set could even be \(U=\{1,2,...,9,10  \}\), the set consisting of the first \(10\) positive integers.
</p>
<H2>Complement of a Set</H2>
<p>
Let \(A\) be any set, then the complement of set \(A\), written as \(A'\), is the set consisting of elements in the universal set \(U\) that are not in \(A\). When you see the complement symbol \('\) you should think <em>not</em> or <em>outside</em>.
</p>

<h3>Example 1C-3: Set Complement</h3>

Let the universal set \(U=\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}\). Let  \(A=\{0,1,2,3,6\}\).

<H2>Venn Diagrams</H2>

<p>
We now use Venn diagrams to illustrate the relations between sets. In the late 1800s, an English logician
named John Venn developed a method to represent relationships between sets. He represented these relationships
using diagrams, which are now known as Venn diagrams. A Venn diagram represents a set as the
interior of a circle. Often two or more circles are enclosed in a rectangle where the rectangle represents the
universal set. To visualize an intersection or union of a set is easy.  Below are a few examples.
</p>

<p><table style="center">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="set1C_Sets_Intervals_and_Inequalities_Union.png"></td>
    <td></br> The shaded region represents the collection of all elements
    </br> that are either in \(A\) or in \(B\), or in both \(A\) and \(B\).</br></br>
    The region is \(A\cup B\)</td>

  </tr>

</table></p>

<p><table style="center">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="set1C_Sets_Intervals_and_Inequalities_Intersection.png"></td>
    <td>The shaded region represents the collection of all elements that are common to both \(A\) and \(B\)</br></br>
    The region is \(A\cap B\)</td>

  </tr>

    <td>The shaded region represents the collection of all elements that are <b>NOT</b> in \(A\).</br></br>
    The region is \(A'\)</td>

  </tr>

</table></p>

<p>
We will now consider sets of numbers defined using inequalities.

<H2>Intervals and Inequalities</H2>
<p>
When \(x = 4\) we have a specific value for our variable.
With inequalities we will give a range of values for our variable. To do this we
will not use equals, but one of the following symbols:
</p>
<center>
<table class = "center">
 <tr>
    <td align="right">\(\gt\)</td>
    <td>Greater than</td>

  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="right"> \(\geq\)</td>
    <td>Greater than or equal to <div class="WWbox">
                       Type the two symbols <b>&gt; = </b> together for \(\geq\)  in <tt>WeBWorK</tt>
                       </div></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">\(\lt\)</td>
    <td>Less than</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">\(\leq\)</td>
    <td>Less than or equal to <div class="WWbox">
                       Type the two symbols <b>&lt; = </b> together for \(\leq\)  in <tt>WeBWorK</tt>
                       </div></td>

  </tr>
</table>
</center> 

<p>
If we have an expression such as \(x \lt 4\) this means our variable can be any number
smaller than \(4\) such as \(-2, 0, 3, 3.9\) or even \(3.999999999\) as long as it is smaller
than \(4\). In other words, \(x \lt 4\) is the set of all numbers less than \(4\).
If we have an expression such as \(x \geq -2\), this means our variable can be
any number greater than or equal to \(-2\), such as \(5, 0,-1,-1.9999\), or even \(-2\).
In other words, \(x \geq -2\) is the set of all numbers greater than or equal to \(-2\).
</p>
<p>
Because we don't have one set value for our variable, it is often useful to draw a
picture of the solutions to the inequality on a number line. We will start from the
value in the problem and bold the lower part of the number line if the variable is
smaller than the number, and bold the upper part of the number line if the variable
is larger. The value itself we will mark with an open or closed circle: open for less
than or greater than, and a closed circle for less than or equal to or greater
than or equal to.
</p>
<p>
Once the graph is drawn we can quickly convert the graph into what is called
interval notation. Interval notation gives two numbers, the first is the smallest
value, the second is the largest value. We will use square brackets if the inequality includes
<b>or equal to</b> (so either \(\leq\) or \(\geq\)).  We will use round brackets if the inequality is
strictly less than or greater than (so either \(\lt\) or \(\gt\)).   If there is no largest value, we can use \(\infty\)
(infinity). If there is no smallest value, we can use \(-\infty\) negative infinity. If we
use either positive or negative infinity we will always use a curved bracket for that
value.
