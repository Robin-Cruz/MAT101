The inequality we solve can get as complex as the linear equations we solved. We
will use all the same patterns to solve these inequalities as we did for solving
equations. Just remember that any time we multiply or divide by a negative number the inequality
symbol switches directions (multiplying or dividing by a positive does not change
the symbol!)
