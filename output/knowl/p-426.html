<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>When graphing a line, one method is to make a table of
values. However, if we can identify some properties of the line, we may be able to
make a graph much quicker and easier. One such method is determining the
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li id="li-57">slope (represented by \(m\)) and the</li>
<li id="li-58">\(y\)-intercept (represented by \(b\) )</li>
</ul>
of the equation. Recall the \(y\)-intercept is
where the line crosses the vertical axis and that \(x = 0\) at this point.  Thus the \(y\)-intercept is the point \((0, b)\) on the line where \(b\)
is the value where the graph crosses the vertical \(y\)-axis. Any other point on the
line can be represented by \((x, y)\). Using this information we will look at the slope
formula and solve the formula for \(y\).</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-39.html#p-426">in-context</a></span>
