Because we don't have one set value for our variable, it is often useful to draw a
picture of the solutions to the inequality on a number line. We will start from the
value in the problem and bold the lower part of the number line if the variable is
smaller than the number, and bold the upper part of the number line if the variable
is larger. The value itself we will mark with an open or closed circle: open for less
than or greater than, and a closed circle for less than or equal to or greater
than or equal to.
