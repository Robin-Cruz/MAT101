<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>We can also move in the opposite direction, using the equation to identify the slope and \(y\)-intercept and graph the equation from this information. However, it will be important for the equation to first be in slope-intercept form. If it is not, we will
have to solve it for \(y\) so we can identify the slope and the \(y\)-intercept.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-39.html#p-434">in-context</a></span>
