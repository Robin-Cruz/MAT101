Notice that point A is in Q1 and point B is in Q2.  Point C is not in a quadrant but is on the \(y\)-axis.  
    Tracing from the origin, point \(A\) is
right 1, up 4. This becomes \(A(1, 4)\).
Point \(B\) is left 5, up 3. Left is backwards
or negative so we have \(B( - 5, 3)\). \(C\) is straight down 2 units. There
is no left or right. This means we go
right zero so the point is \(C(0,-2)\).
  
\(A(1, 4)\text{ is in Q1},B(-5, 3)\text{ is in Q2}\),
     and \(C(0,-2)\) is on the \(y\)-axis
Our Solution 
                     Points in the plane are entered as (#,#)=
                     (horizontal #, vertical #)=(independent, dependent) in WeBWorK.
