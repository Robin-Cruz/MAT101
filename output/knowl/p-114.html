<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5> A set is a collection of objects, and its members are called the elements of the set. We name the set by
using capital letters, and enclose its members in braces \({\cdots}\). Suppose we need to list the members of the chess
club. We use the following set notation:

\[C=\{\text{Ken, Bob, Tran, Shanti, Eric}\}\]

A set that has no members is called an empty set. The empty set is denoted by the symbol \(\emptyset\) or with empty curly braces \(\{\}\).</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-15.html#p-114">in-context</a></span>
