A restaurant has a special choose \(2\) dinner deal: for one low price a customer may select one of two appetizers and one of four main courses.  How many different dinner combinations consisting of one appetizer and one main course are possible?

<figure class="figure-like" id="table-209">
Label the two appetizers \(a_1\) and \(a_2\).
Label the four main dishes \(m_1, m_2, m_3\) and \(m_4\).
  
Create a tree diagram 
    for this problem.
    Step 1: Since we may select 
    one of two appetizers, 
    the tree begins with two branches, one for each of \(a_1\) and \(a_2\).
    Step 2: Then since we may select 
    one of four main course options, 
    each of the first two branches leads to four more branches.  
    The tree has \(2\times 4 = 8\) endpoints,
    one for each of the \(8\) dinner special combinations.

\(8\)
Our Solution: There are \(8\) possible 
        different dinner combinations  consisting of one appetizer and one main course.  
        For example, one combination \(a_2, m_3 \) represents 
        the choice of appetizer \(2\) with main course \(3\).
