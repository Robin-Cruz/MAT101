</h5>
<p>

Graph the points \(A(3, 2), B( - 2, 1), C(3, - 4), D( - 2, - 3), E( - 3, 0), F (0, 2),
G(0, 0)\)

The first point, \(A\) is at \((3, 2)\).  This
means \(x=3\) (right 3) and \(y =2\) (up 2).
Following these instructions, starting
from the origin, we get our point. Note that \(A\) is in Q1.
The second point, \(B( - 2, 1)\), is left 2
(negative moves backwards), up 1.
This is also illustrated on the graph. Note that \(B\) is in Q2.

The third point, \(C(3, - 4)\) is right 3,
down 4 (negative moves backwards).  Note that \(C\) is in Q4.
The fourth point, \(D(-2, -3)\) is left
2, down 3 (both negative, both move
backwards). Note that \(D\) is in Q3.
  </figure><p>The last three points have zeros in them. We still treat these points just like the
other points. If there is a zero there is just no movement.</p>

Next is \(E(-3, 0)\). This is left 3 (negative
is backwards), and up zero, right
on the \(x\)-axis.  Note that \(E\) is on the \(x\)-axis.
Then is \(F(0, 2)\). This is right zero,
and up two, directly on the \(y\)-axis. Note that \(F\) is on the \(y\)-axis.
Finally is \(G(0, 0)\). This point has no
movement. Thus the point is the origin.

Our Solution
  </figure>
</p>
<p>The main purpose of graphs is not to plot random points, but rather to give a
picture of the solutions to an equation. We may have an equation such as \(y =
2x - 3\). To determine whether or not a point \((x,y)\) is a solution to a given equation, you substitute (or "plug in") the values into their corresponding variables in the equation and check to see that you get a true statement (both sides of the equation have equal values).</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-36.html#example-145">in-context</a></span>
