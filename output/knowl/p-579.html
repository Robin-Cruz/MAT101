The complement is useful when you are trying to find the probability of an event that
involves the words "at least" or an event that involves the words "at most". As an example of an at least event is suppose you want to find the probability of making <!--Style me with CSS--><em>at least</em> \(\$50,000\) when you graduate from college. That means you want the probability of your salary being greater than or equal to \(\$50,000\). An example of an at most event is suppose you want to find the probability of rolling a die and getting <!--Style me with CSS--><em>at most</em> a \(4\). That means that you want to get less than or equal to a \(4\) on the die. The reason to use the complement is that sometimes it is easier to find the probability of the complement and then subtract from \(1\).
