<p>
 
A restaurant has a special choose \(2\) dinner deal: for one low price a customer may select one of two appetizers and one of four main courses.  How many different dinner combinations consisting of one appetizer and one main course are possible?

<figure class="figure-like" id="table-229">
Label the two appetizers \(a_1\) and \(a_2\).
Label the four main dishes \(m_1, m_2, m_3\) and \(m_4\).
  
Create a tree diagram 
    for this problem.
    Step 1: Since we may select 
    one of two appetizers, 
    the tree begins with two branches, one for each of \(a_1\) and \(a_2\).
    Step 2: Then since we may select 
    one of four main course options, 
    each of the first two branches leads to four more branches.  
    The tree has \(2\times 4 = 8\) endpoints,
    one for each of the \(8\) dinner special combinations.

\(8\)
Our Solution: There are \(8\) possible 
        different dinner combinations  consisting of one appetizer and one main course.  
        For example, one combination \(a_2, m_3 \) represents 
        the choice of appetizer \(2\) with main course \(3\).

 The tree diagram gives us all eight possibilities. The method involves two steps. First we choose an appetizer. We have two choices: \(a_1\) or \(a_2\). If we choose \(a_1\), we have
four main dishes to go with it; \(m_1, m_2, m_3\) and \(m_4\). Similarly if we choose \(a_2\), we can select any one of the four main dishes, again. The tree diagram helps us visualize these
possibilities.

<p>
The reader should note that the process involves two steps. For the first step of choosing an appetizer, there are two choices, and for each choice of an appetizer, there are four choices of a main dish. So altogether there \(2\cdot 4=8\) possibilities. If, in the above example, we add a dessert, we have the following problem:
