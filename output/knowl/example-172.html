</h5>
<p>

Suppose you are driving from Caldwell to LaGrande, OR to watch the Yotes play a game against Eastern Oregon University.  When you reach Ontario, OR (which is 30 miles into the drive) you are able to set your cruise control at 65 miles per hour (mph) for the remainder of the trip.  The linear function \(D=65t + 30\) represents your distance from Caldwell \(t\) hours after turning on the cruise control.  Notice when \(t=0\), your distance \(D=30\) which corresponds to you being 30 miles from Caldwell (and in Ontario).

Determine the slope and intercept for the model.
Recognize the model as a line in slope-intercept form
    \(y=mx+b\)
  
\(D=65t+30\)
The response is \(D=\) your distance from Caldwell, 
    the predictor is \(t=\) the time you have had the cruise on
  
slope \(=65\)
    intercept \(=30\)
Our Solution
