The first point, \(A\) is at \((3, 2)\).  This
means \(x=3\) (right 3) and \(y =2\) (up 2).
Following these instructions, starting
from the origin, we get our point. Note that \(A\) is in Q1.
The second point, \(B( - 2, 1)\), is left 2
(negative moves backwards), up 1.
This is also illustrated on the graph. Note that \(B\) is in Q2.

The third point, \(C(3, - 4)\) is right 3,
down 4 (negative moves backwards).  Note that \(C\) is in Q4.
The fourth point, \(D(-2, -3)\) is left
2, down 3 (both negative, both move
backwards). Note that \(D\) is in Q3.
