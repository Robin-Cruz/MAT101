\(4(2x -6) + 9 = 3(x -7) + 8x\)
Step 1: Distribute the \(4\) and \(3\) through parenthesis
  
\(\,\,\,\,8x-24+9=3x-21+8x\)
Step 2: Combine like terms \(-24+9\) and \(3x+8x\)
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,8x-15=11x-21\)
Notice the variable \(x\) is on both sides
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\underline{-8x\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, -8x}\)
Step 3: Subtract \(8x\) from both sides
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,-15=3x-21\)
Step 4: Focus on the subtraction of \(21\)
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\underline{+21\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \,\,\, +21}\)
Add \(21\) to both sides
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, 6=3x\)
Focus on the multiplication by \(3\)
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{3}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \overline{3}\)
Divide both sides by \(3\)
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, 2=x\)
Our Solution.  We leave Step 5 for you: check that \(x=2\) IS a solution by logging this value back in to the original equation.
