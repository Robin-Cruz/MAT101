<figure class="figure-like" id="table-81">
\(3(4x-5)-4(2x+1)=5\)
Distribute the \(3\) and \(-4\) through parenthesis
  
\(12x-15-8x-4=5\)
Combine like terms \(12x-8x\) and \(-15-4\)
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,4x-19=5\)
Focus on the subtraction of \(19\)
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\underline{+19\,\,\,\, +19}\)
Add \(19\) to both sides
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, 4x=24\)
Focus on the multiplication by \(4\)
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{4}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \overline{4}\)
Divide both sides by \(4\)
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, x=6\)
Our Solution!

This leads to a \(5\)-step process to solve any linear equation. While all five steps aren't always needed, this can serve as a guide to solving equations.

<li id="li-13">Distribute through any parentheses.</li>
<li id="li-14">Combine like terms on each side of the equation.</li>
<li id="li-15">Get the variable on one side by adding or subtracting.</li>
<li id="li-16">Solve the remaining 2-step equation (add or subtract then multiply or divide).</li>
<li id="li-17">Check your answer by plugging it back in for x to find a true statement.</li>

We can see each of the above five steps worked through our next example.
