If you look at the results of Example 4C-8:, notice that you get \(P(Spade|\text{the card is a }Jack)=\dfrac{1}{4}\) which is exactly the same as \(P(Spade)=\dfrac{13}{52}\) since there are \(13\) spades. This means that knowing that the card is a Jack did not change the probability that the card is a Spade. This added knowledge did not help you in any way. It is as if that information was not given at all. However, if you compare the conditional probability of  Example 4C-4 \(P(D=5|\text{the first die is a }2)=\dfrac{1}{6}\approx 16.67\% \) with \(P(D=5)=\dfrac{n(D=5)}{36}=\dfrac{4}{36}\approx 11.11\%\), you will notice that they are not the same answer. In this case, knowing that the first die is a \(2\) did change the probability of getting a sum of \(5\). In the first case, the events \(Spade\) and \(\text{the card is a }Jack\) are called independent events. In the second case, the events sum of \(5\) and first die is a \(2\) are
called dependent events.
