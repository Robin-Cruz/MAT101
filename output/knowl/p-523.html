  A restaurant has a special choose \(3\) dinner deal: for one low price a customer may select one of two appetizers, one of four main courses, and one of three desserts.  How many different dinner combinations consisting of one appetizer, one main course and one dessert are possible?

<figure class="figure-like" id="table-230">
Label the two appetizers \(a_1\) and \(a_2\).

    Label the four main dishes \(m_1, m_2, m_3\) and \(m_4\).
    Label the three desserts \(d_1, d_2\) and \(d_3\). 

    The tree diagram at the right results.

    (Note that only 6 of the actual possible dinner combinations are listed at the far right.) 

    The tree has \(2\times 4\times 3 = 24\) endpoints,
    one for each of the \(24\) dinner special combinations.
