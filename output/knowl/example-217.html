Suppose you conduct an experiment where you pull a card from a standard deck of cards. Recall this deck has \(4\) suits (black spades \(S\), black clubs \(C\), red diamonds \(D\), and red hearts \(H\)) each with \(13\) cards (numbers \(2\) through \(10\), jack \(J\), queen \(Q\), king \(K\), and ace \(A\)). We will generally consider the face cards to be the jacks, hearts, queens, kings, and aces. Determine the following probabilities.

<figure class="figure-like" id="table-240">
\(SS=\) 
  \( \{2S, 3S, 4S, 5S, 6S, 7S, 8S, 9S, 10S, JS, QS, KS, AS, \) 
   \(2C, 3C, 4C, 5C, 6C, 7C, 8C, 9C, 10C, JC, QC, KC, AC, \) 
   \(\color{red}{2D}, \color{red}{3D}, \color{red}{4D}, \color{red}{5D},   \color{red}{6D}, \color{red}{7D}, \color{red}{8D}, \color{red}{9D}, \color{red}{10D}, \color{red}{JD}, \color{red}{QD}, \color{red}{KD}, \color{red}{AD},\)
   \(\color{red}{2H}, \color{red}{3H}, \color{red}{4H}, \color{red}{5H}, \color{red}{6H}, \color{red}{7H}, \color{red}{8H}, \color{red}{9H}, \color{red}{10H}, \color{red}{JH}, \color{red}{QH}, \color{red}{KH}, \color{red}{AH}\}\)
The sample space has \(52\) outcomes, one for each card in the deck.
  
(a) Determine the probability of selecting a spade.  First write the event space, \(Spade\).
  
\( Spade=\) 
  \(\{2S, 3S, 4S, 5S, 6S, 7S, 8S, 9S, 10S, JS, QS, KS, AS \}\)
The event \(Spade\) contains \(13\) outcomes.
  
\(P(Spade) = \dfrac{n(Spade)}{n(SS)}=\dfrac{13}{52}=\dfrac{1}{4}=0.25\)
Our Solution (a): The probability of selecting a spade is \(\dfrac{13}{52}\) or \(25\%\).
  
(b) Determine the probability of selecting a jack. First write the event space, \(Jack\).
  
\(Jack=\{JS, JC, \color{red}{JH}, \color{red}{JD} \}\)
The event \(Jack\) contains \(4\) outcomes.
  
\(P(Jack) =\dfrac{n(Jack)}{n(SS)}=\dfrac{4}{52}=\dfrac{1}{13}\approx  0.07692\)
Our Solution (b): The probability of selecting a jack is \(\dfrac{4}{52}\) or about \(7.69\%\).
  
(c) Determine the probability of selecting a club or a face card. First write the event space, \(Club \cup Face\).
  
\(Club \cup Face=\) 
  \(\{2C, 3C, 4C, 5C, 6C, 7C, 8C, 9C, 10C, JC, QC, KC, AC, \)
  \( JS, QS, KS, AS, \color{red}{JD}, \color{red}{QD}, \color{red}{KD}, \color{red}{AD}, \color{red}{JH}, \color{red}{QH}, \color{red}{KH}, \color{red}{AH}\}\)
The event \(Club \cup Face\) contains \(25\) outcomes.
  
\(P (Club \cup Face)=  \dfrac{n(Club \cup Face)}{n(SS)}=\dfrac{25}{52} \approx  0.480769\)
Our Solution (c): The probability of selecting a club or a face card is \(\dfrac{25}{52}\) or about \(48.08\%\).
  </figure></p>
<p>
It is also possible to compute probabilities based on the number of times an event \(A\) occurred.
</p>
<p>
The probability of event \(A\) is
\[P(A) = \dfrac{n(A)}{\text{Total # of outcomes}}\]
