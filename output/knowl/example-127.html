\(\left(\dfrac{5}{3} \right)^{-2}\)
Negative exponents yield the reciprocal of the base
  
\(\left(\dfrac{3}{5} \right)^2\)
The reciprocal has a positive exponent, now power rule
  
\(\dfrac{3^2}{5^2}\)
Evaluate
  
\(\dfrac{9}{25}\)
Our Solution

<p>Simplifying with negative exponents is much the same as simplifying with positive exponents. It is the advice of the author to keep the negative exponents until the end of the problem and then "move them around" to their correct location (numerator or denominator). As we do this it is important to be very careful of rules for adding, subtracting, and multiplying with negatives. This is illustrated in the following example:</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-32.html#example-127">in-context</a></span>
