(Recall Example 4B-8.) The number of people who survived the Titanic based on class and gender is in the below table ("Encyclopedia Titanica," 2013). Suppose a person is picked at random from the survivors.

Determine if the events survivor is a female and survivor is in 1st class are independent.
Label the event spaces \(F\) for female and \(1st\) for first class.
  
Compute both  \(P(F|1st)\) and \(P(F)\)
In symbols, \(F\) and \(1st\) are independent if
\(P(F|1st) = P(F)\)
  
\(P(F | 1st) = \dfrac{n(F\cap 1st)}{\text{n(1st)}}=\dfrac{134}{193}\approx 0.6943\)
\(P(F) = \dfrac{n(F)}{\text{Total #}}=\dfrac{308}{450}\approx 0.6844\)
  
 \(P(F|1st) \neq P(F)\)
Since \( 0.6943\neq  0.6844\)
  
The events survivor is a female and survivor is in 1st class are NOT independent.
