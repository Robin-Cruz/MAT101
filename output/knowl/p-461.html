List all the subsets of the set of primary colors \(P = \{ \text{red, yellow, blue} \}\).

<p>
</p>
<figure class="figure-like" id="table-200">
     The subsets are:
  
\(\{ \},\)
\(\{\text{red} \},\)
\(\{\text{yellow} \},\)
\(\{\text{blue} \},\)
  
\(\{\text{red, yellow} \},\)
\(\{\text{red, blue} \},\)
\(\{\text{yellow, blue} \},\)
\(\{\text{red, yellow, blue} \}\)
  
 Note that the empty set \(\{ \}\) is a subset of every set, and a set is a subset of itself.
 Note also that there are \(8= 2^3\) subsets of the original set containing \(3\) elements. In general, a set with \(n\) elements will have \(2^n\) subsets!
  
 
                    Use a comma between elements in a set: {red, yellow} and between subsets: {red},{red, yellow} when entering subsets in WeBWorK.
