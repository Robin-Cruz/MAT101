<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>The main purpose of graphs is not to plot random points, but rather to give a
picture of the solutions to an equation. We may have an equation such as \(y =
2x - 3\). To determine whether or not a point \((x,y)\) is a solution to a given equation, you substitute (or "plug in") the values into their corresponding variables in the equation and check to see that you get a true statement (both sides of the equation have equal values).</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-36.html#p-391">in-context</a></span>
