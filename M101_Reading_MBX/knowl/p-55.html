A final method to simplify is known as distributing. Often as we work with problems
there will be a set of parenthesis that make solving a problem difficult, if not
impossible. To get rid of these unwanted parenthesis we have the distributive
property. Using this property we multiply the number in front of the parenthesis
by each term inside of the parenthesis. </p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-4.html#p-55">in-context</a></span>
