We have two numbers on the same side as the variable \(x\). We need to handle the \(4\) and the \(-20\). We know to "eliminate" the four we need to divide, and to "eliminate" the subtracted twenty we will add twenty to both sides. If order of operations is done backwards,
we add or subtract first. Therefore we will add \(20\) to both sides first.
Once we are done with that, we will divide both sides by \(4\). The steps are shown below.
