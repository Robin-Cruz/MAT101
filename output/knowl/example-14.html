\((-5)^3=(-5)(-5)(-5) \)
The exponent \(3\) means the base \(-5\) is multiplied by itself \(3\) times (there are \(3\) negatives)
  
\(-125\)
Our Solution
  </figure><p>A few things to be careful of when working with integers. First be sure not to
  confuse a problem like \(-3-8\) with \(-3(-8)\). The second problem is a multiplication
  problem because there is nothing between the \(3\) and the parenthesis. If
  there is no operation written in between the parts, then we assume that means we
  are multiplying. The  \(-3-8\) problem is subtraction because the subtraction separates
  the 3 from what comes after it. Another item to watch out for is to be
  careful not to mix up the pattern for adding and subtracting integers with the
  pattern for multiplying and dividing integers. They can look very similar, for
  example if the signs match on addition, the we keep the negative, \(-3 + (-7) = -
  10\), but if the signs match on multiplication, the answer is positive, \((-3)(-7) =
  21\). </p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-2.html#example-14">in-context</a></span>
