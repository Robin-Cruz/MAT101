<figure class="figure-like" id="table-17">
\(\underbrace{30 \div 3} \cdot 2\)
Divide first (left to right!)
  
\(\underbrace{10 \cdot 2}\)
Multiply
  
\(20\)
Our Solution

  In the previous example, if we had multiplied first, five would have been  the answer which is incorrect.</p>
<p>If there are several parenthesis in a problem we will start with the inner most parenthesis and work our way out. Inside each parenthesis we simplify using the order of operations as well. To make it easier to know which parenthesis goes with which parenthesis, different types of parenthesis will be used such as { } and [ ] and ( ), these parenthesis all mean the same thing, they are parenthesis and must be evaluated first.</p> Example 00-18: Order of Operations<figure class="figure-like" id="table-18">
\(2\{8^2 - 7[32 - 4(\underbrace{3^2} + 1)]( - 1)\}\)
Inner most parenthesis, exponents first
  
\(2\{8^2 - 7[32 - 4(\underbrace{9 + 1})]( - 1)\}\)
Add inside those parenthesis
  
\(2\{8^2 - 7[32 -\underbrace{ 4(10)}]( - 1)\}\)
Multiply inside inner most parenthesis
  
\(2\{8^2 - 7[\underbrace{32 - 40}]( - 1)\}\)
Subtract inside those parenthesis
  
\(2\{\underbrace{8^2} - 7[ - 8]( - 1)\}\)
Exponents next
  
\(2\{64\underbrace{- 7[ - 8]}( - 1)\}\)
Multiply left to right, sign with the number
  
\(2\{64 + \underbrace{56( - 1)}\}\)
Finish multiplying
  
\(2\{\underbrace{64 - 56}\}\)
Subtract inside parenthesis
  
\(\underbrace{2\{8\}}\)
Multiply
  
\(16\)
Our Solution

As the above example illustrates, it can take several steps to complete a problem. The key to successfully solve order of operations problems is to take the time to show your work and do one step at a time. This will reduce the chance of making a mistake along the way. </p>
<p>
There are several types of grouping symbols that can be used besides parenthesis. One type is a fraction bar. If we have a fraction, the entire numerator and the entire denominator must be evaluated before we reduce the fraction. In these cases we can simplify in both the numerator and denominator at the same time. </p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-3.html#example-17">in-context</a></span>
