After mastering the technique for solving equations that are one-step equations,
we are ready to consider two-step equations. As we solve two-step equations,
the important thing to remember is that everything works backwards!
When working with one-step equations, we learned that in order to clear a "plus
five" in the equation, we would subtract five from both sides. We learned that to
clear "divided by seven" we multiply by seven on both sides. The same pattern
applies to the order of operations. When solving for our variable x, we use order
of operations backwards as well. This means we will add or subtract first, then
multiply or divide second (then exponents, and finally any parentheses or
grouping symbols, but that's another lesson). So to solve the equation in the first
example:
