  A restaurant has a special choose \(3\) dinner deal: for one low price a customer may select one of two appetizers, one of four main courses, and one of three desserts.  How many different dinner combinations consisting of one appetizer, one main course and one dessert are possible?



<p>
</p>
<figure class="figure-like" id="table-210">
Label the two appetizers \(a_1\) and \(a_2\).

    Label the four main dishes \(m_1, m_2, m_3\) and \(m_4\).
    Label the three desserts \(d_1, d_2\) and \(d_3\). 

    The tree diagram at the right results.

    (Note that only 6 of the actual possible dinner combinations are listed at the far right.) 

    The tree has \(2\times 4\times 3 = 24\) endpoints,
    one for each of the \(24\) dinner special combinations.

24
Our Solution: There are \(24\) possible different dinner combinations consisting of one appetizer, one main course, and one dessert.

<p>
   The important thing to observe here, again, is that this is a three step process. There are two choices for the first step of choosing an appetizer. For each choice of a appetizer, there are four choices of a main course, and for each combination of an appetizer and main course, there are three choices of selecting a dessert. All in all, we have \(2\times 4\times 3 = 24\) different possibilities.
   </p>
<p>
   The tree diagrams help us visualize the different possibilities, but they are not practical when the possibilities are numerous. Besides, we are mostly interested in counting the number of elements in the set and not the actual possibilities. But once the problem is envisioned, we can solve it without a tree diagram. The two examples we just solved may have given us a clue to do just that.
   </p>
<p>
   Let us now try to solve Example 4A-10: without a tree diagram. Recall that the problem involved three steps: choosing an appetizer, choosing a main course, and choosing a dessert. The number of ways of choosing each are listed below.
   </p>
<p>

  </figure></p>
<p>
By multiplying these three numbers we get \(2\cdot 4\cdot 3=24\), which is what we got when we did the problem using a tree diagram.  The procedure we just employed is called the multiplication axiom.
</p>
<p>The Multiplication Axiom: If a task can be done in \(m\) ways, and a second task can be done in \(n\) ways, then the operation involving the first task followed by the second can be performed in \(m\cdot n\) ways.</p>
<p>
The general multiplication axiom is not limited to just two tasks and can be used for any number of tasks.
