</h5>
<p>

Continue with the linear model \(D=65t + 30\) representing your distance \(D\) (in miles) from Caldwell \(t\) hours after using cruise. How many hours after setting your cruise control will you be \(225\) miles from Caldwell?

</p>
<figure class="figure-like" id="table-211">
\(D=\) distance from Caldwell
Recall what the response variable represents
  
When is \(225=D\)?
Write an equation to model the problem
  
\(225=65t+30\)
<!--Style me with CSS--><em>This is an equation to model the problem. </em> 
    Solve for \(t\): subtract \(30\) from both sides
  
\(195=65t\)
Divide both sides by \(65\)
  
\(3=t\)
State what this means in context
  
After \(t=3\) hours of cruise control 
     you are \(225\) miles from Caldwell
Our solution
  
The graph of the linear model demonstrates the
    \(D\)-intercept of \(30\) miles,
    increasing slope of \(65\) mph and 
    distance of \(225\)miles when the time is \(3\) hours.
