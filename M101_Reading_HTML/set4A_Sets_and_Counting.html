<h1>MAT-101: Set 4A-Sets and Counting</h1>

<h3>Objectives:</h3>
<ul>
   <li>Use set theory and Venn diagrams to solve counting problems. </li>
   <li>Use tree diagrams and the Multiplication Axiom to solve counting problems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sets</h2>

<p> You are already familiar with the concept of sets from <b>Set 1C-Sets, Intervals and Inequalities</b>.  Recall:
</p>

<ul>
     <li>A <b>set</b> is a collection of objects, and its members are called the <b>elements</b> of the set.</li>
     <li>We name the set by using capital letters, and enclose its members in braces. For example, the set of primary colors could be denoted \(P = \{ \text{red, yellow, blue} \}\).</li>
     <li>A set that has no members is called an <b>empty set</b>. The empty set is denoted by the symbol \(\emptyset\) or with empty curly braces \(\{\}\).</li>
     <li>Two sets are <b>equal</b> if they have the same elements.</li>
     <li>A set \(A\) is a <b>subset</b> of a set \(B\) if every member of \(A\) is also a member of \(B\). For example, suppose and \(A = \{\text{blue, red}\}\). Then \(A\) is a subset of \(P\), written as \(A\subseteq P\).</li>
     <li> Every set is a subset of itself, \(A \subseteq A\). The empty set is a subset of every set, \(\emptyset \subseteq A\).</li>
     <li>The <b>union</b> of \(A\) and \(B\), written as \(A\cup B\), is the set of all elements that are either in \(A\) <b>OR</b> in \(B\), or in both \(A\) and \(B\).</li>
     <li>The <b>intersection</b> of \(A\) and \(B\), written as \(A\cap B\), is the set of all elements that are common to both sets \(A\) <b>AND</b> \(B\).</li>
     <li>A <b>universal set</b> \(U\) is the set consisting of all elements under consideration.</li>
     <li>The <b>complement</b> of set \(A\), written as \(A'\), is the set consisting of elements in the universal set \(U\) that are <b>NOT</b> in \(A\).</li>
</ul>

<p> A concept not discussed in <b>Set 1C</b> is disjoint sets.
Two sets \(A\) and \(B\) are called <b>disjoint</b> sets if their intersection is an empty set.  This would be denoted \(A\cap B = \emptyset\).  The following examples demonstrate the above ideas regarding sets.
</p>

<h3>Example 4A-1: Subsets</h3>
List all the subsets of the set of primary colors \(P = \{ \text{red, yellow, blue} \}\).

Recall a Venn diagram represents a set as the
interior of a circle. Often two or more circles are enclosed in a rectangle where the rectangle represents the
universal set. These diagrams allow us to visualize an intersection or union of two sets or the complement of a set.  We will now use Venn
diagrams to sort various populations and count objects.  We use the notation \(n(A)\) to represent the number of elements in set \(A\).  For example, \(n(P\cup N) = 4\) in <b>Example 4A-2</b>.
</p>

<h3>Example 4A-3: 2-Group Venn Diagram</h3> 
Suppose a survey of car enthusiasts showed that over a certain time period, \(30\) drove cars with automatic transmissions, \(20\) drove cars with standard transmissions, and \(12\) drove cars of both types. If every person in the survey drove cars with one of these transmissions, how many people
participated in the survey?

<h3>Example 4A-4: 2-Group Venn Diagram</h3> 
A survey of \(100\) people in California indicates that \(60\) people have visited Disneyland, \(15\) have visited Knott's Berry Farm, and \(6\) have visited both. How many people have visited neither place?
<!--   http://cnx.org/content/col10613/1.5/ Example 11.7 page 171 -->
<p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Let set \(D\) represent those surveyed who have visited Disneyland.</td>
    <td>Let set \(K\) represent those surveyed who have visited Knott's Berry Farm.</td>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">Since \(6\) have visited both</br>
    Record \(\color{red}{6}\) in \(=D\cap K\)</br>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align =" right"> Because \(60\) people visited Disneyland, </br>

    This means \(x + 6 = 60\).</br>
        Subtract \(6\) from both sides to get</br>
         \(x = 54\).</br>
    Record \(\color{blue}{54}\) in \(D\) but <b>NOT</b> in \(K\).</td>
    <td><img src="set4A_Sets_and_Counting_06.png"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align =" right"> Because \(15\) people visited Knott's, </br>
     \(K\) must contain \(15\) total people. </br>
    This means \(y + 6 = 15\).</br>
        Subtract \(6\) from both sides to get</br>
         \(y = 9\).</br>
    Record \(\color{green}{9}\) in \(K\) but <b>NOT</b> in \(D\).</td>
    <td><img src="set4A_Sets_and_Counting_07.png"></td>

  <tr>
    <td align =" right">  Let \(\color{brown}{z}\) be the number in</br>
         the rectangle representing the universal set</br>
         \(U\) but <b>NOT</b> in \(D\) nor in \(K\).</br>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Since \(100\) people participated in the survey,</br>
      \(U\) must contain \(100\) objects. </br>
      This means \(54+6+9+z = 100\)</br>
      or \(69+z=100\).</br>
        Subtract \(69\) from both sides to get</br>
         \(z = 31\).</br>
          Record \(\color{brown}{31}\) in \((D\cup K)'\).
     </td>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">\(31=n(D\cup K)'\) </td>
    <td>Our Solution: \(31\) people have visited neither place.</td>
  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>Looking back at the final Venn diagram of the survey of \(100\) people in California, we can organize the results in a two-way table as follows:
</p>

<p>
<table align="center" border="1">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">\(\,\)</td>
    <td align="center">Disneyland (\(D\))</td>
    <td align="center">Not Disneyland (\(D'\))</td>
    <td align="center">Total</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td  align ="center">Knott's (\(K\))</td>
    <td  align ="center">\(\color{red}{6}\)</td>
    <td  align ="center">\(\color{green}{9}\)</td>
    <td  align ="center">\(15\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td  align ="center">Not Knott's (\(K'\))</td>
    <td  align ="center">\(\color{blue}{54}\)</td>
    <td  align ="center">\(\color{brown}{31}\)</td>
    <td  align ="center">\(85\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td  align ="center">Total</td>
    <td  align ="center">\(\fbox{60}\)</td>
    <td  align ="center">\(40\)</td>
    <td  align ="center">\(100\)</td>
  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>
Notice from the above table, we can determine particular counts.  For example, at the bottom of the Disneyland column is the boxed number \(\fbox{60}\), which is the total number of people surveyed who visited Disneyland.  The red \(\color{red}{6}\) is the intersection of row Knott's and column Disneyland, which is \(n(D\cap K)\), the number of people who visited both parks.  The \(\color{brown}{31}=n(D'\cap K')\) means \(\color{brown}{31}\) did not attend either park.
</p>

<p>
We are not limited to \(2\) circles.  Suppose a survey of \(100\) exercise conscious people resulted in the following information:
<ol>
  <li>\(50\) jog, \(30\) swim, and \(35\) cycle</li>
  <li>\(14\) jog and swim</li>
  <li>\(7\) swim and cycle</li>
  <li>\(9\) jog and cycle</li>
  <li>\(3\) people take part in all three activities</li>
</ol>
Since we have \(3\) exercise categories (jog, swim, cycle) we will use three circles, one for each group. Use the exercise survey results to assign a number to each region in a corresponding Venn diagram and then answer the given questions in the following examples:
</p>


<h3>Example 4A-5: 3-Group Venn Diagram</h3>

    place a \(\color{red}{3}\) in \(=J\cap S\cap C\)</br>
     Let \(\color{blue}{x}=n((J\cap S)\cap C')\)</br>
     (people that jog and swim but don't cycle).</br>
     Let \(\color{green}{y}=n((J\cap C)\cap S')\).</br>

<h2>Tree Diagrams and the Multiplication Axiom</h2>

<p>
In this Module, we are developing counting techniques that will be used in the following Module to study probability. One of the most fundamental of such techniques is called the <b>Multiplication Axiom</b>. Before we
introduce the multiplication axiom, we first consider some examples.
</p>

<h3>Example 4A-9: 2-Step Tree Diagram</h3> 
A restaurant has a special choose \(2\) dinner deal: for one low price a customer may select one of two appetizers and one of four main courses.  How many different dinner combinations consisting of one appetizer and one main course are possible?

<!--   Modeled after http://cnx.org/content/col10613/1.5/ Example 11.9 page 173 but less sexist!! -->
<p>
<table class = "center">
 <tr>
    <td align="right">Label the two appetizers \(a_1\) and \(a_2\).</td>
    <td>Label the four main dishes \(m_1, m_2, m_3\) and \(m_4\).</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="right">Create a tree diagram </br>
    for this problem.</br></br>
    <b>Step 1:</b> Since we may select </br>
    one of two appetizers, </br>
    the tree begins with two branches, </br>one for each of \(a_1\) and \(a_2\).</br></br>
    <b>Step 2: </b>Then since we may select </br>
    one of four main course options, </br>
    each of the first two branches leads to four more branches. </br> </br>
    The tree has \(2\times 4 = 8\) endpoints,</br>
    one for each of the \(8\) dinner special combinations.
    <td><img src="set4A_Sets_and_Counting_18.png"></td>
    </td>

    <tr>
        <td align="right">\(8\)</td>
        <td>Our Solution: There are \(8\) possible </br>
        different dinner combinations </br> consisting of one appetizer and one main course. </br> </br>
        For example, one combination \(a_2, m_3 \) represents </br>
        the choice of appetizer \(2\) with main course \(3\).</td>
    </tr>
  </tr> </table></p>

  <p>
 The tree diagram gives us all eight possibilities. The method involves two steps. First we choose an appetizer. We have two choices: \(a_1\) or \(a_2\). If we choose \(a_1\), we have
four main dishes to go with it; \(m_1, m_2, m_3\) and \(m_4\). Similarly if we choose \(a_2\), we can select any one of the four main dishes, again. The tree diagram helps us visualize these
possibilities.
</p>
<p>
The reader should note that the process involves two steps. For the first step of choosing an appetizer, there are two choices, and for each choice of an appetizer, there are four choices of a main dish. So altogether there \(2\cdot 4=8\) possibilities. If, in the above example, we add a dessert, we have the following problem:
  </p>

  <h3>Example 4A-10: 3-Step Tree Diagram</h3> 
  A restaurant has a special choose \(3\) dinner deal: for one low price a customer may select one of two appetizers, one of four main courses, and one of three desserts.  How many different dinner combinations consisting of one appetizer, one main course and one dessert are possible?

<!--   Modeled after http://cnx.org/content/col10613/1.5/ Example 11.10 page 174 but less sexist!! -->

    <td align="right">Label the two appetizers \(a_1\) and \(a_2\).</br>

    Label the four main dishes \(m_1, m_2, m_3\) and \(m_4\).</br>
    Label the three desserts \(d_1, d_2\) and \(d_3\).</br> </br>

    The tree diagram at the right results.</br>

    (Note that only 6 of the actual possible dinner combinations are listed at the far right.) </br>

    The tree has \(2\times 4\times 3 = 24\) endpoints,</br>
    one for each of the \(24\) dinner special combinations.

    </td>
   <td><img src="set4A_Sets_and_Counting_19.png"  width ="407" height="273"></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td align =" right">24</td>
   <td>Our Solution: There are \(24\) possible different dinner combinations consisting of one appetizer, one main course, and one dessert. </td>
   </tr>
   </table></p>

   <p>
   The important thing to observe here, again, is that this is a three step process. There are two choices for the first step of choosing an appetizer. For each choice of a appetizer, there are four choices of a main course, and for each combination of an appetizer and main course, there are three choices of selecting a dessert. All in all, we have \(2\times 4\times 3 = 24\) different possibilities.
   </p>

   <p>
   The tree diagrams help us visualize the different possibilities, but they are not practical when the possibilities are numerous. Besides, we are mostly interested in counting the number of elements in the set and not the actual possibilities. But once the problem is envisioned, we can solve it without a tree diagram. The two examples we just solved may have given us a clue to do just that.

   <p>
   Let us now try to solve <b>Example 4A-10:</b> without a tree diagram. Recall that the problem involved three steps: choosing an appetizer, choosing a main course, and choosing a dessert. The number of ways of choosing each are listed below.
   </p>

    <p>
    <table align="center"  border="1">
  <tr>
    <td  align="center">The number of ways</br>
    of choosing an appetizer
    </td>
    <td  align="center">The number of ways</br>
     of choosing a main course
    </td>
    <td align="center">The number of ways</br>
     of choosing a dessert
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td  align ="center">\(2\)
    </td>
    <td  align="center">\(4\)
    </td>
    <td  align ="center">\(3\)
    </td>
  </tr>
</table></p>
<p>
By multiplying these three numbers we get \(2\cdot 4\cdot 3=24\), which is what we got when we did the problem using a tree diagram.  The procedure we just employed is called the multiplication axiom.
</p>
<p><center>
<b>The Multiplication Axiom</b>: If a task can be done in \(m\) ways, and a second task can be done in \(n\) ways, then the operation involving the first task followed by the second can be performed in \(m\cdot n\) ways.</center>
</p>
<p>
The general multiplication axiom is not limited to just two tasks and can be used for any number of tasks.

 We list all eight possibilities below:</p>
 <p><center>
 TTT, TTF, TFT, TFF, FTT, FTF, FFT, FFF</center>
 </p>

<p>
The reader should note that the first letter in each possibility is the answer corresponding to the first question, the second letter corresponds to the answer to the second question and so on. For example, TFF, says that the answer to the first question is given as true, and the answers to the second and third questions false.
