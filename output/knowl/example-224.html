In an experiment of picking one card from a deck, what is the probability of getting a Jack and an Ace? What is the probability of getting a Jack or an Ace? What is the probability of getting a Spade or an Ace?

 
 <p>

<figure class="figure-like" id="table-249">
(a) Determine the probability of selecting a Jack \(J\) AND an Ace \(A\).
First write the event space, \(J\cap A\).
  
\(J\cap A=\{ \}\)
The event \(J\cap A\) contains \(0\) outcomes since you can't do that with one
card.
  
\(P(J\cap A) =\dfrac{0}{52}\)
Our Solution (a): The probability of getting a Jack and an Ace is \(0\).
  
(b) Determine the probability of selecting a Jack \(J\) OR an Ace \(A\).
First write the event space, \(J\cup A\).
  
\(J\cup A=\{JS, JC, JD, JH, AS, AC, AD, AH \}\)
The event \(J\cup A\) contains \(8\) outcomes.
  
\(P(J\cup A) =\dfrac{8}{52}\approx 0.1538\)
Our Solution (b): The probability of getting a Jack or an Ace is \(\dfrac{8}{52}\) or approximately \(15.38\%\).
  
(c) Determine the probability of selecting a Spade \(S\) OR an Ace \(A\).
First write the event space, \(S\cup A\).
  
\(S\cup A=\{2S, 3S, 4S, 5S, 6S, 7S, 8S, 9S, 10S,\) 
        \(JS, QS, KS, AS, AC, AD, AH \}\)
The event \(S\cup A\) contains \(16\) outcomes.
  
\(P(S\cup A) =\dfrac{16}{52}\approx 0.3077\)
Our Solution (c): The probability of getting a Spade or an Ace is \(\dfrac{16}{52}\) or approximately \(30.77\%\).

<p>
The first part of Example 4C-4 demonstrates an impossible event: selecting a Jack and an Ace on one draw.  The second and third parts demonstrate another probability concept.  Notice that:
</p>
<p>
\(P(J\cup A) =\dfrac{8}{52} = \dfrac{4}{52}+ \dfrac{4}{52} = P(J) + P(A)\)
\(P(S\cup A) =\dfrac{16}{52} \neq \dfrac{17}{52} = \dfrac{13}{52}+ \dfrac{4}{52} = P(S) + P(A)\)
</p>
<p>
Why does adding two individual probabilities together work in one situation to give the
probability of one or another event and not give the correct probability in the other?
</p>
<p>
The reason this is true in the case of the Jack and the Ace is that these two events cannot happen together. There is no overlap between the two events, and in fact the
\(P(J \cap A) = 0\). However, in the case of the Spade and Ace, they can happen
together. There is overlap, mainly the ace of spades. The \(P(S \cap A) \neq 0\).
</p>
<p>
When two events cannot happen at the same time, they are called mutually exclusive. In the above situation, the events Jack and Ace are mutually exclusive, while the events Spade and Ace are not mutually exclusive.
</p>
<p>

Addition Rules: 
    If two events \(A\) and \(B\) are mutually exclusive, then
    \(P(A\cup B) =P(A)+ P(B)\) and \(P(A\cap B)=0\).  
    If two events \(A\) and \(B\) are not mutually exclusive, then
     \(P(A\cup B) =P(A)+ P(B) -P(A\cap B)\).
