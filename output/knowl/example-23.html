\(8x^2-3x+7-2x^2+4x-3\)
Combine like terms \(8x^2-2x^2\) and \(-3x+4x\) and \(7-3\)
  
\(6x^2+x+4\)
Our Solution 
                       Type x^2  for \( x^2 \) in WeBWorK

As we combine like terms we need to interpret subtraction signs as part of the following
term. This means if we see a subtraction sign, we treat the following term
like a negative term, the sign always stays with the term. </p>
<p>
A final method to simplify is known as distributing. Often as we work with problems
there will be a set of parenthesis that make solving a problem difficult, if not
impossible. To get rid of these unwanted parenthesis we have the distributive
property. Using this property we multiply the number in front of the parenthesis
by each term inside of the parenthesis. </p>Distributive Property:\(a(b+c)=ab+ac\)<p>
Several examples of using the distributive property are given below. </p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-4.html#example-23">in-context</a></span>
