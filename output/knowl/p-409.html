<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>Rise would be a vertical change, or a change in the \(y\)-values. Run would be a horizontal
change, or a change in the \(x\)-values. So another way to describe slope
would be the fraction \(\frac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in } x}\) . It turns out that if we have a graph we can draw
vertical and horizontal lines from one point to another to make what is called a
slope triangle. The sides of the slope triangle give us our slope. The following
examples show graphs that we find the slope of using this idea.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-38.html#p-409">in-context</a></span>
