Recall the intersection of the points in the graph
would be all values in both the first interval AND the second 
This is points common to both (or in the overlap)
For example, \(-3\) is in both the top and bottom intervals, so \(-3\) is in the intersection
        But \(2.7\) is in the bottom interval but not the top, so \(2.7\) is NOT in the intersection
        and \(5\) is in neither interval, so \(5\) is NOT in the intersection
Notice the overlap of the two intervals is all numbers in the first interval
  
\((-\infty, -3]\)
An interval describing the intersection
  
\(x \leq -3\)
An inequality describing the intersection 
                       Type x  = -3 for the inequality \(x \leq -3\) in WeBWorK
