<figure class="figure-like" id="table-32">
\(\dfrac{36}{84}\)
Both numerator and denominator are divisible by \(4\)
  
\(\dfrac{36 \div 4}{84 \div 4} = \dfrac{9}{21}\)
Both numerator and denominator are still divisible by \(3\)
  
\(\dfrac{9 \div 3}{21 \div 3} = \dfrac{3}{7}\)
Our solution 
                       Type 3/7 for \( \dfrac{3}{7} \) in WeBWorK

The previous example could have been done in one step by dividing both numerator
and denominator by \(12.\) We also could have divided by \(2\) twice and then
divided by \(3\) once (in any order). It is not important which method we use as
long as we continue reducing our fraction until it cannot be reduced any further.  Another way to reduce th fraction in Example 1A-1 is given in the next example
