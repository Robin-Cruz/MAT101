<figure class="figure-like">
\(2(x-5) + 3x = x + 18\)
Distribute the \(2\) through parenthesis
  
\(2x-10 + 3x = x + 18\)
Combine like terms \(2x+ 3x\)
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,5x-10 = x + 18\)
Notice the variable \(x\) on both sides, \(x\) is smaller
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\underline{-x\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, -x\,\,\,\,\,\,}\)
Subtract \(x\) to both sides
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,4x-10=18\)
Focus on the subtraction of \(10\)
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\underline{+10\,\,\,\, +10}\)
Add \(10\) to both sides
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, 4x=28\)
Focus on the multiplication by \(4\)
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\overline{4}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \overline{4}\)
Divide both sides by \(4\)
  
\(\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, x=7\)
