</h5>
<p>
 
 A family has three children. Determine the probability of the family having at least two girls.

<figure class="figure-like" id="table-237">
\(SS=\{BBB,BBG,BGB,BGG,GBB,GBG,GGB,GGG \}\)
The sample space has \(8\) outcomes.
  
Determine the probability of the family having at least two girls.
First write the event space, \(A\).
  
\(A=\{BGG, GBG, GGB, GGG \}\)
The event \(A\) contains \(4\) outcomes with at least \(2\) girls.
  
\(P(A) = \dfrac{\text{# of outcomes in event space }}{\text{# of outcomes in sample space }}=\dfrac{4}{8}=\dfrac{1}{2}=0.5\)
Our Solution: The probability of the family having at least two girls is \(\dfrac{1}{2}\) or \(50\%\).
