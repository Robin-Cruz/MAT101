Let set \(J\) represent the joggers, set \(S\) the swimmers and set \(C\) the cyclers.
We always begin by first assigning the number to the innermost region and then working our way out.
  
Since \(3\) people participate in all three activities
    place a \(\color{red}{3}\) in \(=J\cap S\cap C\)
     Let \(\color{blue}{x}=n((J\cap S)\cap C')\)
     (people that jog and swim but don't cycle).
     Let \(\color{green}{y}=n((J\cap C)\cap S')\).
     Let \(\color{brown}{z}=n((S\cap C)\cap J')\).

Since \(14\) jog and swim
   \(x+3=14\), so \(\color{blue}{x = 11}\).
     Since \(9\) jog and cycle
   \(y+3=9\), so \(\color{green}{y = 6}\).
      Since \(7\) swim and cycle
   \(z+3=7\), so \(\color{brown}{z = 4}\).
   After replacing \(x,y,z\) with these values
   label the regions \(\color{red}{m}, \color{blue}{n},\color{green}{ p}\).

Since \(50\) people jog
   \(m + 11+3+6=50\), so \(\color{red}{m =30 }\).
     Since \(30\) swim
   \(n+11+3+4=30\), so \(\color{blue}{n = 12}\).
      Since \(35\) cycle
   \(p+6+3+4=35\), so \(\color{green}{p = 22}\).

  By adding all the entries in all three sets, 
        we get a sum of \(88\). 
        Since \(100\) people were surveyed,
        the number inside the universal set but outside of all three sets is 
        \(100-88=\color{red}{12}\)
