</h5>
<p>
 
Recall in Example 4A-4:  we considered a survey of \(100\) people in California indicating that \(60\) people had visited Disneyland, \(15\) had visited Knott's Berry Farm, and \(6\) had visited both.  Determine the following probabilities using the Venn diagram.

<figure class="figure-like" id="table-225">
 Let set \(D\) represent those surveyed who have visited Disneyland.
    Let set \(K\) represent those surveyed who have visited Knott's Berry Farm.
    We completed the Venn diagram at the right.

Determine the probability that a person surveyed went to Disneyland.
Label the event space \(D\) for Disneyland.
  
\(n(D)=54+6=60\)
The number of people surveyed who went to Disneyland.
  
\(P(D) = \dfrac{n(D)}{\text{Total #}}=\dfrac{60}{100}= 0.6\)
Our First Solution: The probability that a person surveyed went to Disneyland is \(\dfrac{60}{100}\) or \(60\%\).
  
Determine the probability that a person surveyed went to both parks.
Label the event space \(D\cap K\) for Disneyland AND Knott's.
  
\(n(D\cap K)=6\)
The number of people surveyed who went to both parks.
  
\(P(D\cap K) = \dfrac{n(D\cap K)}{\text{Total #}}=\dfrac{6}{100}= 0.06\)
Our Second Solution: The probability that a person surveyed went to both parks is \(\dfrac{6}{100}\) or \(6\%\).
  
Determine the probability that a person surveyed went to either Knott's or Disneyland (or both).
Label the event space \(D\cup K\) for Disneyland OR Knott's.
  
\(n(D\cup K)=54+6+9=69\)
The number of people surveyed who went to either park (or both).
  
\(P(D\cup K) =\dfrac{69}{100}= 0.69\)
Our Third Solution: The probability that a person surveyed went to either park is \(\dfrac{69}{100}\) or \(69\%\).
