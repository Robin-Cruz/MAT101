The plane is divided into four regions, called quadrants, by a horizontal number line (\(x\)-axis)
and a vertical number line (\(y\)-axis). 
 The quadrants are labeled Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 and proceed counterclockwise around the plane as shown in the graph at the left.
 Where the two lines meet in the center
is called the origin, marked by the green point. This center origin
is where \(x = 0\) and \(y = 0\).
