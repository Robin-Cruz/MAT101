Determine if the events survivor is a female and survivor is in the 1st class are mutually exclusive.
Label the event spaces \(F\) for female and \(1st\) for first class.
  
Determine \(n(F\cap 1st)\)
Mutually exclusive events cannot happen at the same time which means there would be no overlap or intersection.
  
\(n(F\cap 1st)=134\)
Our Solution: Since there were female survivors from the 1st class, the events survivor is a female and survivor is in the 1st class are NOT mutually exclusive.
