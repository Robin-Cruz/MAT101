Determine the probability that a survivor was female.
Label the event space \(F\) for female.
  
\(P(F) = \dfrac{n(F)}{\text{Total #}}=\dfrac{308}{450}\approx 0.6844\)
Our First Solution: The probability that a survivor was female is \(\dfrac{308}{450}\) or about \(68.44\%\).
  
Determine the probability that a survivor was female and in the 1st class.
Label the event space \(F\cap 1st\) for female AND in the 1st class.
  
\(n(F\cap 1st)=134\)
The number of survivors in both the \(F\) column and 1st row.
  
\(P(F\cap 1st) = \dfrac{n(F\cap 1st)}{\text{Total #}}=\dfrac{134}{450}\approx 0.2978\)
Our Second Solution: The probability that a survivor was a first-class female is \(\dfrac{134}{450}\) or about \(29.78\%\).
  
Determine the probability that a survivor was female or in the 1st class.
Label the event space \(F\cup 1st\) for female OR in the 1st class.
  
\(n(F\cup 1st)=134+94+80+59=367\)
The number of survivors in either the \(F\) column or 1st row.
  
\(P(F\cup 1st) = \dfrac{n(F\cup 1st)}{\text{Total #}}=\dfrac{367}{450}\approx 0.8156\)
Our Third Solution: The probability that a survivor was female OR in first class is \(\dfrac{367}{450}\) or about \(81.56\%\).
