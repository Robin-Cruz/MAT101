<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>Lines with zero slope or no slope can make a problem seem very different. Zero slope, corresponding to a horizontal line, will simply have a slope of zero which when multiplied by \(x\) gives zero in the equation. So the equation simply becomes \(y = b\) or \(y\) is equal to the \(y\)-intercept of the graph. If we have no slope (or undefined slope), or a vertical line, the equation can't be
written in slope-intercept form at all because the slope is undefined. There is no \(y\) in these equations. We will simply make \(x\) equal to the \(x\)-intercept of the graph.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-39.html#p-440">in-context</a></span>
