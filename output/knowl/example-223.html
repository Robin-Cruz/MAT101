The \(SS\) is written in Example 4B-4.
Recall the sample space has \(36\) outcomes.
  
Rolling a sum that is at least \(4\) would involve listing all of the sums that are \(4\) or more.
It would be much easier to list the outcomes that make up the
complement.
  
Determine the probability of rolling a sum less than \(4\).
First write \(D\) for the sum of the dots showing. Write the event space \((D\lt 4)\).
  
\((D\lt 4) =\{(\color{red}{1},\color{green}{1}), (\color{red}{1},\color{green}{2}),  (\color{red}{2},\color{green}{1})\}\)
The event \((D\lt 4)\) contains \(3\) outcomes with a sum less than  \(4\).
  
\(P(D\lt 4) =\dfrac{3}{36}\)
Next use complementary events.
  
\(P(D\ge 4) = 1-P(D\lt 4)= 1-\dfrac{3}{36}=\dfrac{33}{36}\approx  0.9167\)
Our Solution: The probability of rolling a sum of at least a \(4\) is \(\dfrac{33}{36}\) or about \(91.67\%\).
