Write \(F\) for the event getting the flu.
Then \(F'\) is the event not getting the flu.
  
\(P(F') = 0.24\)
 We know the probability of not getting the flu is \(0.24\).
  
\(P(F)=1-P(F')\)
Use complementary events.
  
\(P(F)=1-0.24=0.76\)
Our Solution: The probability of getting the flu is  \(0.76\) or \(76\%\). Since the probability of getting the flu is greater than the probability of not getting the flu, it is more likely to get the flu than not.
