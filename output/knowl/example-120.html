\((4x^2 y^5)^3\)
Put the exponent of \(3\) on each factor, multiplying powers
  
\(4^3 x^6 y^{15}\)
Evaluate \(4^3=4\cdot 4\cdot 4\)
  
\(64x^6 y^{15}\)
Our Solution
  </figure></p>
<p>In the previous example we did not put the \(3\) on the \(4\) and multipy to get \(12\), this would have been incorrect. Never multiply a base by the exponent. These properties pertain to exponents only, not bases. </p>
<p>In this lesson we have discussed \(5\) different exponent properties. These rules are summarized in the following table: </p>Rules of Exponents<p>

<figure class="figure-like" id="table-133">
Product Rule of Exponents
\(a^m a^n=a^{m+n}\)
  
Quotient Rule of Exponents
\(\frac{a^m}{a^n} =a^{m-n}\)
  
Power of a Power Rule of Exponents
\((a^m)^n=a^{mn}\)
  
Power of a Product Rule of Exponents
 \((ab)^m=a^m b^m\)
  
Power of a Quotient Rule of Exponents
\(\left(\frac{a}{b} \right)^m=\frac{a^m}{b^m}\)
  </figure></p>
<p>These five properties are often mixed up in the same problem. Often there is a bit of flexibility as to which property is used first. However, order of operations PEMDAS still applies to a problem. For this reason it is our suggestion to simplify inside any parentheses first, then simplify any exponents (using power rules), and finally simplify any multiplication or division (using product and quotient rules). This is illustrated in the next few examples: </p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-31.html#example-120">in-context</a></span>
