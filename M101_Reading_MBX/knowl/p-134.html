If we have an expression such as \(x \lt 4\) this means our variable can be any number
smaller than \(4\) such as \(-2, 0, 3, 3.9\) or even \(3.999999999\) as long as it is smaller
than \(4\). In other words, \(x \lt 4\) is the set of all numbers less than \(4\).
If we have an expression such as \(x \geq -2\), this means our variable can be
any number greater than or equal to \(-2\), such as \(5, 0,-1,-1.9999\), or even \(-2\).
In other words, \(x \geq -2\) is the set of all numbers greater than or equal to \(-2\).
