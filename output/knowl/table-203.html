Let set \(D\) represent those surveyed who have visited Disneyland.
Let set \(K\) represent those surveyed who have visited Knott's Berry Farm.
  
Since \(6\) have visited both
    Record \(\color{red}{6}\) in \(=D\cap K\)
     Let \(\color{blue}{x}=n(D\cap K')\).
     Let \(\color{green}{y}=n(K\cap D')\).
<img width="90%" src="set4A_Sets_and_Counting_05.png" alt="">
  
 Because \(60\) people visited Disneyland, 
    \(D\) must contain \(60\) total people. 
    This means \(x + 6 = 60\).
        Subtract \(6\) from both sides to get
         \(x = 54\).
    Record \(\color{blue}{54}\) in \(D\) but NOT in \(K\).
<img width="90%" src="set4A_Sets_and_Counting_06.png" alt="">
  
 Because \(15\) people visited Knott's, 
     \(K\) must contain \(15\) total people. 
    This means \(y + 6 = 15\).
        Subtract \(6\) from both sides to get
         \(y = 9\).
    Record \(\color{green}{9}\) in \(K\) but NOT in \(D\).
<img width="90%" src="set4A_Sets_and_Counting_07.png" alt="">
  
  Let \(\color{brown}{z}\) be the number in
         the rectangle representing the universal set
         \(U\) but NOT in \(D\) nor in \(K\).
     Thus \(z=n(D\cup K)'\).
<img width="90%" src="set4A_Sets_and_Counting_08.png" alt="">
  
Since \(100\) people participated in the survey,
      \(U\) must contain \(100\) objects. 
      This means \(54+6+9+z = 100\)
      or \(69+z=100\).
        Subtract \(69\) from both sides to get
         \(z = 31\).
          Record \(\color{brown}{31}\) in \((D\cup K)'\).
<img width="90%" src="set4A_Sets_and_Counting_09.png" alt="">
  
\(31=n(D\cup K)'\)
Our Solution: \(31\) people have visited neither place.
