Events \(A\) and \(B\) are considered independent events if the fact that one event happens does not change the probability of the other event happening. In other words, events \(A\) and \(B\) are independent if the fact that \(B\) has happened does not affect the probability of event \(A\) happening and the fact that \(A\) has happened does not affect the probability of event \(B\) happening. Otherwise, the two events are dependent. </p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-56.html#p-604">in-context</a></span>
