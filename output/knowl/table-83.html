Start with the true statement \(5\gt 1\)
Add \(3\) to both sides
  
We now have \(8\gt 4\)
This is still true.  Now subtract \(2\) from both sides
  
We now have \(6&gt;2\)
This is still true.  Next multiply both sides by \(3\)
  
We now have \(18\gt 6\)
This is still true.  Now divide both sides by \(2\)
  
We now have \(9\gt 3\)
This is still true.  Next add \(-1\) to both sides
  
We now have \(8\gt 2\)
This is still true.  Next multiply both sides by \(-1\)
  
We now have \(-8\color{red}{\lt}-2\)
Notice the inequality sign changed direction to keep this true!
  
Continue with \(-8\lt -2\)
Now divide both sides by \(-2\)
  
We now have \(4\color{red}{\gt}1\)
Notice the inequality sign changed direction again to keep this true!
