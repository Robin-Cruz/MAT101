<h1>MAT-101: Set 3C-Linear Models</h1>


<h3>Objectives:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Determine the slope of a given linear model and describe its meaning, in context.</li>
  <li>Use a given linear model to solve problems.</li>
  <li>Create a linear model from data to solve problems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Linear Models</h2>

<p>Now that you have an understanding of lines, we will consider linear models.  A <b>linear model</b> is an equation for a line that is connected to a real-world situation or data. What does this mean? </p>
<p>Recall when we write the equation for a line:</p>
\[y=mx+b\]
<p>that \(y\) represents the <b>dependent variable</b> (sometimes called the "response" variable) and \(x\) represents the <b>independent variable</b> (sometimes called the "predictor"). Plugging in a particular value of \(x\) gives, or "predicts," a corresponding value for the response \(y\). The value of the slope \(m\) of the line represents the estimated change in the response variable \(y\) for a one-unit change in the predictor variable \(x\). Finally, the value of \(b\) (the \(y\)-intercept ) is the value of the response \(y\) when the predictor \(x\) is zero. To summarize:
<ul>
  <li>\(y\) is the <b>response</b> variable (it responds to changes in \(x\))</li>
  <li>\(x\) is the <b>predictor</b> variable</li>
  <li>\(m\) represents the estimated change in the response \(y\) for a one-unit change in the predictor \(x\)</li>
  <li>\(b\) is the value of the response \(y\) when the predictor \(x=0\) </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Recall that points in the plane are denoted \( (x,y)=(independent, dependent) =(predictor, response).\) Consider some examples of linear models.</p>

<h3>Example 3C-1 (a): Determine Slope and Intercept of Given Model</h3>
Suppose you are driving from Caldwell to LaGrande, OR to watch the Yotes play a game against Eastern Oregon University.  When you reach Ontario, OR (which is 30 miles into the drive) you are able to set your cruise control at 65 miles per hour (mph) for the remainder of the trip.  The linear function \(D=65t + 30\) represents your distance from Caldwell \(t\) hours after turning on the cruise control.  Notice when \(t=0\), your distance \(D=30\) which corresponds to you being 30 miles from Caldwell (and in Ontario).

<h3>Example 3C-2 (a): Determine Slope and Intercept of Given Model</h3>
A study of king penguins looked for a relationship between how deep the penguins dive to seek food and how long they stay underwater.  The data from the study produced the linear model \(DD = 0.0072D + 3\), where \(DD\) represents the dive duration in minutes (min) and \(D\) represents the depth in meters (m).

<p>Often researchers record observations over time and use a linear model to represent the situation. Consider some examples.</p>

<h3>Example 3C-3 (a): Data Points</h3>
In 1980, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States was \(3\) trillion dollars.  In 1990 it was \(6\) trillion dollars.
