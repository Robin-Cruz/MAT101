 Graph  \(3x+4y=12\)
Not in slope intercept form
  
 \(\underline{-3x\hphantom{12345}-3x}\)
Subtract \(3x\) from both sides
  
\(4y =-3x+12\)
Put \(x\) term first
  
 \(\overline{4}\hphantom{1234}\overline{4}\hphantom{12345}\overline{4}\)
Divide each term by \(4\)
  
\(y=-\dfrac{3}{4}x+3\)
Recall the slope-intercept formula
  
 \(y =mx+b\)
Identify the slope, \(m\), and the \(y\)-intercept, \(b\)
  
 \(m=-\dfrac{3}{4}, b=3\)
Make the graph
  
<img width="90%" src="set3B_Lines_Ex_13.png" alt="">
Start with a point at the \(y\)-intercept of \(3\).Then use the slope \(\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}\), but it's negative so it will go downhill: go down \(3\) units and run \(4\) units right to plot the next point.
    Once we have both points, connect the dots to get our graph.
  </figure><p>We want to be very careful not to confuse using slope to find the next point with using a coordinate such as \((4, -2)\) to find an individual point. Coordinates such as
\((4, -2)\) start from the origin \((0,0)\) and move horizontally first, and vertically second.
Slope starts from a point on the line that could be anywhere on the graph. The numerator of the slope is the vertical change and the denominator is the horizontal change.</p>
<p>Lines with zero slope or no slope can make a problem seem very different. Zero slope, corresponding to a horizontal line, will simply have a slope of zero which when multiplied by \(x\) gives zero in the equation. So the equation simply becomes \(y = b\) or \(y\) is equal to the \(y\)-intercept of the graph. If we have no slope (or undefined slope), or a vertical line, the equation can't be
written in slope-intercept form at all because the slope is undefined. There is no \(y\) in these equations. We will simply make \(x\) equal to the \(x\)-intercept of the graph.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-39.html#example-169">in-context</a></span>
