    <title>Fractions</title>
    <p>Working with fractions is a very important foundation to algebra. Here we will briefly review reducing, multiplying, dividing, adding, and subtracting fractions. As this is a review, concepts will not be explained in detail as other lessons are.</p>

    <p>A fraction can be used to represent parts of a whole. The fraction bar shown above represents the fraction
      <m>\frac{1}{3}</m> since one of three equal parts of the bar is shaded. Recall that the integer
      <m>7</m> can be written as the fraction.
    </p>
    <p>We always like our final answers when working with fractions to be reduced (the numerator and denominator are divided by their greatest common factor (
      <b>GCF</b>)). This is shown in the following example:

      <p>The previous Example <xref ref="reduce-36-over-84" /> could have been done in one step by dividing both numerator and denominator by
        <m>12.</m> We also could have divided by
        <m>2</m> twice and then divided by
        <m>3</m> once (in any order). It is not important which method we use as long as we continue reducing our fraction until it cannot be reduced any further.  Another way to reduce th fraction in Example <xref ref="reduce-36-over-84" /> is given in the next example

    <title>Multiplication and Division of Fractions</title>
    <p>The easiest operation with fractions is multiplication. We can multiply fractions by multiplying straight across, multiplying numerators together and denominators together.</p>

      <p>Dividing fractions is very similar to multiplying with one extra step. Dividing fractions requires us to first take the reciprocal of the second fraction and multiply. Once we do this, the multiplication problem solves just as the previous problem.</p>

    <title>Common Denominators</title>
    <p>To add and subtract fractions we will first have to determine the least common denominator (LCD). There are several ways to determine an LCD. One way is to determine the smallest multiple of the larger denominator that is also divisible by the smaller denominator.</p>
