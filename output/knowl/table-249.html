(a) Determine the probability of selecting a Jack \(J\) AND an Ace \(A\).
First write the event space, \(J\cap A\).
  
\(J\cap A=\{ \}\)
The event \(J\cap A\) contains \(0\) outcomes since you can't do that with one
card.
  
\(P(J\cap A) =\dfrac{0}{52}\)
Our Solution (a): The probability of getting a Jack and an Ace is \(0\).
  
(b) Determine the probability of selecting a Jack \(J\) OR an Ace \(A\).
First write the event space, \(J\cup A\).
  
\(J\cup A=\{JS, JC, JD, JH, AS, AC, AD, AH \}\)
The event \(J\cup A\) contains \(8\) outcomes.
  
\(P(J\cup A) =\dfrac{8}{52}\approx 0.1538\)
Our Solution (b): The probability of getting a Jack or an Ace is \(\dfrac{8}{52}\) or approximately \(15.38\%\).
  
(c) Determine the probability of selecting a Spade \(S\) OR an Ace \(A\).
First write the event space, \(S\cup A\).
  
\(S\cup A=\{2S, 3S, 4S, 5S, 6S, 7S, 8S, 9S, 10S,\) 
        \(JS, QS, KS, AS, AC, AD, AH \}\)
The event \(S\cup A\) contains \(16\) outcomes.
  
\(P(S\cup A) =\dfrac{16}{52}\approx 0.3077\)
Our Solution (c): The probability of getting a Spade or an Ace is \(\dfrac{16}{52}\) or approximately \(30.77\%\).
