The examples and WeBWorK problems of <b>Set 4B-Probability</b> demonstrated some important probability results which are summarized below.

<title>Complementary Events</title>


<p>
Recall the <b>complement</b> of set <m>A</m>, written as <m>A'</m>, is the set consisting of elements in the universal set <m>U</m> that are <b>NOT</b> in <m>A</m>.
</p>
<p>
<div class="boxed">
    If two events are <b>complementary events</b> then their probabilities add up to one.  That is 
    <m>P(A) + P(A') =1</m>, or <m>P(A)=1-P(A')</m>, or <m>P(A')=1-P(A)</m>.
</div></p>

<example>
<title> Complementary Events--Flu</title>
<p>

 Suppose you know the probability of not getting the flu is <m>0.24</m>. What is the probability of getting the flu?

<td>Our Solution: The probability of getting the flu is  <m>0.76</m> or <m>76\%</m>. Since the probability of getting the flu is greater than the probability of not getting the flu, it is more likely to get the flu than not.</td>

<p>
The complement is useful when you are trying to find the probability of an event that
involves the words "at least" or an event that involves the words "at most". As an example of an at least event is suppose you want to find the probability of making <em><b>at least</b></em> <m>\$50,000</m> when you graduate from college. That means you want the probability of your salary being greater than or equal to <m>\$50,000</m>. An example of an at most event is suppose you want to find the probability of rolling a die and getting <em><b>at most</b></em> a <m>4</m>. That means that you want to get less than or equal to a <m>4</m> on the die. The reason to use the complement is that sometimes it is easier to find the probability of the complement and then subtract from <m>1</m>.
</p>

</example>

<example>
<title> Complementary Events--At Least</title>
<p>

Two fair dice are rolled. Determine the probability of rolling a sum of at least a <m>4</m>.

<title> Probability--Cards</title>
<p>

In an experiment of picking one card from a deck, what is the probability of getting a Jack and an Ace? What is the probability of getting a Jack or an Ace? What is the probability of getting a Spade or an Ace?

 <!--   This is CoconinoCC_chapter_4_Probability.pdf Section 4.2 Example 4.2.5, page 121 -->

<table  align="center">

  </tr>
</table></p>

<p>
The first part of <b>Example 4C-4</b> demonstrates an <b>impossible event</b>: selecting a Jack and an Ace on one draw.  The second and third parts demonstrate another probability concept.  Notice that:
</p>
<p>
<m>P(J\cup A) =\dfrac{8}{52} = \dfrac{4}{52}+ \dfrac{4}{52} = P(J) + P(A)</m>
<m>P(S\cup A) =\dfrac{16}{52} \neq \dfrac{17}{52} = \dfrac{13}{52}+ \dfrac{4}{52} = P(S) + P(A)</m>
</p>

<p>
Why does adding two individual probabilities together work in one situation to give the
probability of one or another event and not give the correct probability in the other?
</p>
<p>
The reason this is true in the case of the Jack and the Ace is that these two events cannot happen together. There is no overlap between the two events, and in fact the
<m>P(J \cap A) = 0</m>. However, in the case of the Spade and Ace, they can happen
together. There is overlap, mainly the ace of spades. The <m>P(S \cap A) \neq 0</m>.
</p>
<p>
When two events cannot happen at the same time, they are called <b>mutually exclusive</b>. In the above situation, the events Jack and Ace are mutually exclusive, while the events Spade and Ace are not mutually exclusive.
</p>
<p>
<div class="boxed">
<b>Addition Rules:</b> 
    If two events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are mutually exclusive, then
    <m>P(A\cup B) =P(A)+ P(B)</m> and <m>P(A\cap B)=0</m>.  
    If two events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are not mutually exclusive, then
     <m>P(A\cup B) =P(A)+ P(B) -P(A\cap B)</m>.

<title>Conditional Probability</title>


<p>
Suppose you want to figure out if you should buy a new car. When you first go and look, you find two cars that you like the most. In your mind they are equal, and so each has a <m>50\%</m> chance that you will pick it. Then you start to look at the reviews of the cars and realize that the first car has had <m>40\%</m> of them needing to be repaired in the first year, while the second car only has <m>10\%</m> of the cars needing to be repaired in the first year. You could use this information to help you decide which car you want to actually purchase. Both cars no longer have a <m>50\%</m> chance of being the car you choose. You could actually calculate the probability you will buy each car, which is a conditional probability. You probably wouldn't do this, but it gives you an example of what a conditional probability is.
</p>

<p>
<b>Conditional probabilities</b> are probabilities calculated after information is given. This is where you want to find the probability of event <m>A</m> happening after you know that event <m>B</m> has happened. If you know that <m>B</m> has happened, then you don't need to consider the rest of the sample space. You only need the outcomes that make up event <m>B</m>. Event <m>B</m> becomes the new sample space, which is called the restricted sample space, <m>R</m>. If you always write a restricted sample space when doing conditional probabilities and use this as your sample space, you will have no trouble with conditional probabilities. The notation for conditional probabilities is <m>P(A, \text{ given } B) = P(A|B)</m>. The event following the vertical line is always the restricted sample space.

 Suppose you pick a card from a deck. What is the probability of getting a Spade, given that the card is a Jack?

<td>Our Solution: The probability of getting a Spade, given that the card is a Jack is <m>\dfrac{1}{4}</m> or <m>25\%</m>.</td>
  </tr>
</table></p>
<p>
If you look at the results of <b>Example 4C-8:</b>, notice that you get <m>P(Spade|\text{the card is a }Jack)=\dfrac{1}{4}</m> which is exactly the same as <m>P(Spade)=\dfrac{13}{52}</m> since there are <m>13</m> spades. This means that knowing that the card is a Jack did not change the probability that the card is a Spade. This added knowledge did not help you in any way. It is as if that information was not given at all. However, if you compare the conditional probability of  <b>Example 4C-4</b> <m>P(D=5|\text{the first die is a }2)=\dfrac{1}{6}\approx 16.67\% </m> with <m>P(D=5)=\dfrac{n(D=5)}{36}=\dfrac{4}{36}\approx 11.11\%</m>, you will notice that they are not the same answer. In this case, knowing that the first die is a <m>2</m> did change the probability of getting a sum of <m>5</m>. In the first case, the events <m>Spade</m> and <m>\text{the card is a }Jack</m> are called<b> independent events</b>. In the second case, the events sum of <m>5</m> and first die is a <m>2</m> are
called <b>dependent events</b>.

<section>
<title>Independent Events</title>

<p>
Events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are considered <b>independent events</b> if the fact that one event happens does not change the probability of the other event happening. In other words, events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are independent if the fact that <m>B</m> has happened does not affect the probability of event <m>A</m> happening and the fact that <m>A</m> has happened does not affect the probability of event <m>B</m> happening. Otherwise, the two events are dependent. </p>
<p>
<div class="boxed">
In symbols, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <b>independent</b> if
<m>P(A|B) = P(A)</m> or <m>P(B|A) = P(B)</m>.

<p>Two events <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are independent if the fact that <m>B</m> has happened does not affect the probability of event <m>A</m> happening.  In the case of offspring, we consider the genders to be independent.  This means, the probability of the gender of the second child is not affected by the actual gender of the first child born.  Consider the following example. </p>

<title> Probability Tree</title>
<p>

Male calico cats are quite rare.  In fact, the probability of a cat having a boy calico kitten is only <m>3\%</m>.  Suppose a cat has <m>3</m> calico kittens.  Use a <b>probability tree</b> to determine the following probabilities.
