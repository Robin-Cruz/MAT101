Let \(B\) represent a boy kitten.
  Let \(G\) represent a girl kitten.
Illustrate the possibilities with a tree diagram.
  

    The tree has \(8\) endpoints, 
    one for each element in the sample space.

    The possibility \(BGB\), for example, 
    indicates that the first kitten is a boy, 
    the second born a girl, and the third a boy.

\(P(B)=0.03\)
Determine the probability of a girl using complementary events, since \(B' = G\).
  
\(P(G)=P(B')=1-P(B)=1-0.03=0.97\)
Label the corresponding branches of the tree.
  

    Each branch with an outcome of \(B\)  
    has a \(0.03\) chance of occurring.

    Each branch with an outcome of \(G\)  
    has a \(0.97\) chance of occurring.

(a) Determine the probability of all \(3\) calico kittens being boys.
Multiply the probabilities along the path to the outcome \(BBB\).
  
\(P(BBB)=(0.03)(0.03)(0.03) = 0.000027\).
Our Solution (a):  The probability of all \(3\) calico kittens being boys is \(0.0027\%\), which is extremely unlikely.
  
(b) Determine the probability of at least one of the calico kittens being a boy.
Recall complementary events help determine probabilities of events involving "at least".
  
Notice there is only one outcome with no male kittens: \(GGG\).
All of the other outcomes have at least one male kitten.
  
This means the event "at least one boy" 
    is the complement of the event \(GGG\)
Use the complement: 
   \(P(\text{at least one boy})=1-P(GGG)\).
  
\(P(GGG)= (0.97)(0.97)(0.97)\approx 0.9127\)
Multiply the probabilities along the path to the outcome \(GGG\).
  
\(P(\text{at least one boy})=1-P(GGG)\) 
  \(=1-(0.97)^3\approx 1-0.9127=0.0873\)
Our Solution (b): The probability of at least one of the calico kittens being a boy is approximately \(8.73\%\).
