<figure class="figure-like" id="table-70">
\(5x\color{red}{+7} = 7\)
Start by focusing on the plus \(7\)
  
\(\underline{-7\phantom{1}-7}\)
Subtract \(7\)  from both sides
  
\(5x \phantom{123} = 0\)
Now we focus on the \(5\) multiplied by \(x\)
  
\(\overline{ 5 } \phantom{1234567} \overline{ 5 }\)
Divide both sides by \(5\) (recall \(\frac{0}{5}=0\))
  
\(x =0\)
Our Solution
  </figure><p>
Notice the seven subtracted out completely! Many students get stuck on this
point, do not forget that we have a number for "nothing left" and that number is
zero. With this in mind the process is almost identical to our first example.

<p>
A common error students make with two-step equations is with negative signs.
Remember the sign always stays with the number. Consider the following
example.
