A survey of \(100\) people in California indicates that \(60\) people have visited Disneyland, \(15\) have visited Knott's Berry Farm, and \(6\) have visited both. How many people have visited neither place?

<p>
</p>
<figure class="figure-like" id="table-203">
Let set \(D\) represent those surveyed who have visited Disneyland.
Let set \(K\) represent those surveyed who have visited Knott's Berry Farm.
  
Since \(6\) have visited both
    Record \(\color{red}{6}\) in \(=D\cap K\)
     Let \(\color{blue}{x}=n(D\cap K')\).
     Let \(\color{green}{y}=n(K\cap D')\).
<img width="90%" src="set4A_Sets_and_Counting_05.png" alt="">
  
 Because \(60\) people visited Disneyland, 
    \(D\) must contain \(60\) total people. 
    This means \(x + 6 = 60\).
        Subtract \(6\) from both sides to get
         \(x = 54\).
    Record \(\color{blue}{54}\) in \(D\) but NOT in \(K\).
<img width="90%" src="set4A_Sets_and_Counting_06.png" alt="">
  
 Because \(15\) people visited Knott's, 
     \(K\) must contain \(15\) total people. 
    This means \(y + 6 = 15\).
        Subtract \(6\) from both sides to get
         \(y = 9\).
    Record \(\color{green}{9}\) in \(K\) but NOT in \(D\).
<img width="90%" src="set4A_Sets_and_Counting_07.png" alt="">
  
  Let \(\color{brown}{z}\) be the number in
         the rectangle representing the universal set
         \(U\) but NOT in \(D\) nor in \(K\).
     Thus \(z=n(D\cup K)'\).
<img width="90%" src="set4A_Sets_and_Counting_08.png" alt="">
  
Since \(100\) people participated in the survey,
      \(U\) must contain \(100\) objects. 
      This means \(54+6+9+z = 100\)
      or \(69+z=100\).
        Subtract \(69\) from both sides to get
         \(z = 31\).
          Record \(\color{brown}{31}\) in \((D\cup K)'\).
<img width="90%" src="set4A_Sets_and_Counting_09.png" alt="">
  
\(31=n(D\cup K)'\)
Our Solution: \(31\) people have visited neither place.
  </figure></p>
<p>Looking back at the final Venn diagram of the survey of \(100\) people in California, we can organize the results in a two-way table as follows:
</p>
<p>
<figure class="figure-like" id="table-204">
\(\,\)
Disneyland (\(D\))
Not Disneyland (\(D'\))
Total
  
Knott's (\(K\))
\(\color{red}{6}\)
\(\color{green}{9}\)
\(15\)
  
Not Knott's (\(K'\))
\(\color{blue}{54}\)
\(\color{brown}{31}\)
\(85\)
  
Total
\(\fbox{60}\)
\(40\)
\(100\)
  </figure></p>
<p>
Notice from the above table, we can determine particular counts.  For example, at the bottom of the Disneyland column is the boxed number \(\fbox{60}\), which is the total number of people surveyed who visited Disneyland.  The red \(\color{red}{6}\) is the intersection of row Knott's and column Disneyland, which is \(n(D\cap K)\), the number of people who visited both parks.  The \(\color{brown}{31}=n(D'\cap K')\) means \(\color{brown}{31}\) did not attend either park.
</p>
<p>
We are not limited to \(2\) circles.  Suppose a survey of \(100\) exercise conscious people resulted in the following information:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li id="li-81">\(50\) jog, \(30\) swim, and \(35\) cycle</li>
<li id="li-82">\(14\) jog and swim</li>
<li id="li-83">\(7\) swim and cycle</li>
<li id="li-84">\(9\) jog and cycle</li>
<li id="li-85">\(3\) people take part in all three activities</li>
</ol>
Since we have \(3\) exercise categories (jog, swim, cycle) we will use three circles, one for each group. Use the exercise survey results to assign a number to each region in a corresponding Venn diagram and then answer the given questions in the following examples:
