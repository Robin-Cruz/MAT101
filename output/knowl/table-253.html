(a) Determine the probability that a survivor was in the first class.
Label the event space \(1st\) for first class.
  
\(P(F) = \dfrac{n(1st)}{\text{Total #}}=\dfrac{193}{450}\approx 0.4289\)
Our Solution (a): The probability that a survivor was in the first class is \(\dfrac{193}{450}\) or about \(42.89\%\).
  
(b) Determine the probability that a survivor was female given the person was in the 1st class.
Label the event space \(F | 1st\) for female GIVEN in the 1st class.
  
In this case we know the person is in 1st class because of the GIVEN.
Only the number of survivors in the 1st row will be considered.
  
\(P(F | 1st) = \dfrac{n(F\cap 1st)}{\text{n(1st)}}=\dfrac{134}{193}\approx 0.6943\)
Our Solution (b): The probability that a survivor was a female given the person was in the first class is \(\dfrac{134}{193}\) or about \(69.43\%\).
