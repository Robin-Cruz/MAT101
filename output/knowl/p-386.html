<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>The exponent, \(b\), is very important to how we convert between scientific notation and normal numbers, or standard notation. The exponent tells us how many times we will multiply by \(10\). Multiplying by \(10\) in effect moves the decimal point
one place. So the exponent will tell us how many times the decimal moves
between scientific notation and standard notation. To decide which direction to
move the decimal (left or right) we simply need to remember that positive exponents mean we have a big number (bigger than ten) in standard notation and negative
exponents mean we have a small number (less than
one) in standard notation.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-40.html#p-386">in-context</a></span>
