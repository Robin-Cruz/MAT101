<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>We want to be very careful not to confuse using slope to find the next point with using a coordinate such as \((4, -2)\) to find an individual point. Coordinates such as
\((4, -2)\) start from the origin \((0,0)\) and move horizontally first, and vertically second.
Slope starts from a point on the line that could be anywhere on the graph. The numerator of the slope is the vertical change and the denominator is the horizontal change.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-46.html#p-475">in-context</a></span>
