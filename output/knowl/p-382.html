<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>Often, to get an idea of the behavior of an equation we will make a picture that
represents the solutions to the equations. A graph is simply a picture of the solutions
to an equation. Before we spend much time on making a visual representation
of an equation, we first have to understand the basis of graphing. Following
