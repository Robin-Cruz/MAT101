In the LaTeXtoLaTeX directory, this command will convert html files
in one directory into mbx files in another directory.

./ltol.py ../M101_Reading_HTML/ ../M101_Reading_MBX/


Note that the individual chapter files are created each time you run
that command, but the main index.mbx file has to be created by hand.

Then run xsltproc on index.mbx

The pictures will be missing because the files beed to be moved to the
MBX directory.
