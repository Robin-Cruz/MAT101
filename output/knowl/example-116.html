<figure class="figure-like" id="table-127">
\((ab)^3\)
This means we have \((ab)\) three times
  
\((ab)(ab)(ab)\)
The product of three \(a\)'s and three \(b\)'s can be written with exponents
  
\(a^3 b^3\)
Our Solution
  </figure></p>
<p>A quicker method to arrive at the solution would have been to take the exponent of three and put it on each factor in parenthesis, \((ab)^3 = a^3b^3\). This is known as the power of a product rule of exponents:</p>
<p>Power of a Product Rule of Exponents: \((ab)^m=a^m b^m\)</p>
<p>It is important to be careful to only use the power of a product rule with multiplication inside parenthesis. This property does NOT work if there is addition or subtraction inside the parentheses.</p>WARNING:<p>
<figure class="figure-like" id="table-128">
\((a+b)^m\ne a^m+b^m\)
These are NOT equal if \(m\ne 1\), beware of this error!
  </figure></p>
<p>Another property that is very similar to the power of a product rule is considered next.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-31.html#example-116">in-context</a></span>
