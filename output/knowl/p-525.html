   The important thing to observe here, again, is that this is a three step process. There are two choices for the first step of choosing an appetizer. For each choice of a appetizer, there are four choices of a main course, and for each combination of an appetizer and main course, there are three choices of selecting a dessert. All in all, we have \(2\times 4\times 3 = 24\) different possibilities.
