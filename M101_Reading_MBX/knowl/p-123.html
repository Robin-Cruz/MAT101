A universal set \(U\) is the set consisting of all elements under consideration.  For example, if we were interested in computing probabilities of particular poker hands the universal set would be the set of all \(52\) cards in a regular deck of cards.  If we were interested in GPAs of students at C of I, the universal set \(U=\{\text{GPAs of all students at C of I}\}\).  Or the universal set could even be \(U=\{1,2,...,9,10  \}\), the set consisting of the first \(10\) positive integers.
