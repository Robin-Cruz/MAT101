Notice from the above table, we can determine particular counts.  For example, at the bottom of the Disneyland column is the boxed number \(\fbox{60}\), which is the total number of people surveyed who visited Disneyland.  The red \(\color{red}{6}\) is the intersection of row Knott's and column Disneyland, which is \(n(D\cap K)\), the number of people who visited both parks.  The \(\color{brown}{31}=n(D'\cap K')\) means \(\color{brown}{31}\) did not attend either park.
