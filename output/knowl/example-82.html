<figure class="figure-like" id="table-87">
\(4x + -20= -8\)
  </figure><p>
We have two numbers on the same side as the variable \(x\). We need to handle the \(4\) and the \(-20\). We know to "eliminate" the four we need to divide, and to "eliminate" the subtracted twenty we will add twenty to both sides. If order of operations is done backwards,
we add or subtract first. Therefore we will add \(20\) to both sides first.
Once we are done with that, we will divide both sides by \(4\). The steps are shown below.
</p>
<figure class="figure-like" id="table-88">
\(4x\color{red}{-20} = -8\)
Start by focusing on the subtract \(20\)
  
\(\phantom{123456}\underline{+20\,\,+20}\)
Add \(20\)  to both sides
  
\(4x \phantom{1234} = 12\)
Now we focus on the \(4\) multiplied by \(x\)
  
\(\overline{ 4 } \phantom{12345678} \overline{ 4 }\)
Divide both sides by \(4\)
  
\(x =3\)
Our Solution!
  </figure><p>
One way we can check the correctness of Our Solution is to substitute \(x=3\) back in to the original equation:
</p>
<figure class="figure-like" id="table-89">
\(4x-20 = -8\)
Substitute \(x=3\) into the LHS
  
\(4(3)-20\)
Multiply \(4(3)\)
  
\(12-20\)
Subtract \(12-20\)
  
\(-8\)
\(-8=-8\): The left-hand side equals the right-hand side: LHS=RHS
  </figure><p>
Since we get a true statement \(-8=-8\), Our Solution \(x=3\) is correct.
</p>

The same process is used to solve any two-step equations. Add or subtract first,
then multiply or divide. Consider our next example and notice how the same process is applied.
