<p><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>As you can see there is a big difference between having a zero slope and having no
slope or undefined slope. Remember, slope is a measure of steepness. The first
slope is not steep at all, in fact it is flat. Therefore it has a zero slope. The
second slope can't get any steeper. It is so steep that there is no number large
enough to express how steep it is. This is an undefined slope.</p><span class="incontext"><a href="section-38.html#p-414">in-context</a></span>
